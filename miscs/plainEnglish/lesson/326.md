|This is              |This is the first Plain English lesson of 2021, and it’s number 326.                                                                                                                                                                | 
|I’m Jeff,            |I’m Jeff, JR, as always, is the producer, and he has posted the full lesson online at PlainEnglish.com/326.                                                                                                                         | 
|Let’s kick           |Let’s kick of 2021 with a little self-improvement: passwords.                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|If that              |If that word causes anxiety, then you’re probably not using a password manager.                                                                                                                                                     | 
|Don’t worry:         |Don’t worry: I’m not either.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|But today,           |But today, we’ll talk about the benefits of using a password manager and why I will be adopting one in 2021.                                                                                                                        | 
|The expression       |The expression is “a breeze” and we have a quote of the week.                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|We’ve all            |We’ve all been there.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|You’re staring       |You’re staring at the login screen for your bank’s website, or Amazon or a streaming service, and you can’t remember what password you used.                                                                                        | 
|How are              |How are you going to get into your account?                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Or perhaps           |Or perhaps it’s a site you think you visited this time last year, when you were buying a holiday gift, but you can’t remember for sure.                                                                                             | 
|Did you              |Did you register?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Do you               |Do you have an account?                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|If you               |If you do, what e-mail address did you use for that?                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|It’s a               |It’s a problem any internet user has faced: most of us have dozens or even hundreds of accounts, and each account needs a username and a password.                                                                                  | 
|Some people          |Some people try to make things easier on themselves by using the same password for different sites.                                                                                                                                 | 
|Or perhaps           |Or perhaps all their passwords start the same way but have different letters or numbers at the end.                                                                                                                                 | 
|By now,              |By now, we all know reusing passwords is a bad idea.                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|If just              |If just one site gets hacked, you are at risk even if you don’t have payment details stored with that vendor.                                                                                                                       | 
|Here’s why:          |Here’s why: the hackers often sell the combination of the username and password.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Then, other          |Then, other hackers can try that same combination on many hundreds of web sites.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|If you               |If you register as a user on a blog, and that blog’s data is stolen, then hackers will try your email and password combination on many other sites, like banks or shopping sites.                                                   | 
|They use             |They use elaborate scripts to do this with thousands of usernames and sites, all at a high speed.                                                                                                                                   | 
|So we                |So we know reusing passwords is bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|But guess            |But guess what?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|So many              |So many people do it anyway—and I am even guilty of that.                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|NA                   |Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Because it’s         |Because it’s easier. w I know it’s wrong, but sometimes I just can’t bring myself to invent a strong password and then track it somehow.                                                                                            | 
|One solution         |One solution to this is to store passwords in a Word or Excel document.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|I’ve done            |I’ve done this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|But this             |But this can get unwieldy and hard to manage; plus, that document could get hacked and then you’d really be in trouble.                                                                                                             | 
|Another problem      |Another problem is that you don’t always have access to that document, especially if you use multiple devices.                                                                                                                      | 
|Plus, there’s        |Plus, there’s still the problem of inventing a secure password.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|The scripts          |The scripts hackers use rely on words in the dictionary, so any password that contains a dictionary word or a name or a small combination of numbers is an easy password to hack.                                                   | 
|Unfortunately, these |Unfortunately, these are the passwords our human brains can invent and remember, too.                                                                                                                                               | 
|The solution         |The solution is one of those long passwords with a nonsensical combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.                                                                                                                        | 
|But it’s             |But it’s exhausting to try to create one as a human, much less remember it or save it for later.                                                                                                                                    | 
|If this              |If this password dilemma sounds familiar, don’t worry.                                                                                                                                                                              |

|Password managers    |Password managers are flexible: they come as browser extensions, desktop apps for Mac and Windows, and mobile apps for iOS and Android.                                                                                             |

|The most             |The most popular password managers are LastPass, 1Password, and Dashlane.                                                                                                                                                           |

|LastPass in          |LastPass in particular has a great free version.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Dashlane lets        |Dashlane lets you store 50 passwords free, but the paid version is only three dollars a month—a bargain when you consider everything that’s at stake.                                                                               | 
|Most password        |Most password managers work in the same way.                                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|When you             |When you register with a website for the first time, your password manager will create a new password for you.                                                                                                                      | 
|You can              |You can choose how long you want it to be, and how complicated.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|You can              |You can also enter passwords you’ve come up with yourself, if you prefer.                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Either way,          |Either way, your password manager tells you how strong your new password is, and then remembers it for you along with the username you chose.                                                                                       | 
|The next             |The next time you visit that website, your password manager will fill in the username and password you created, making logging in a breeze.                                                                                         | 
|All you              |All you need to do is login to the password manager itself to get at all the passwords stored within its vault.                                                                                                                     | 
|No matter            |No matter how many unique passwords you create, and no matter how complicated they are, all you ever need to remember is one master password.                                                                                       |

|Password managers    |Password managers are good for storing all sorts of sensitive information that you might want to fill into forms online, but that you can’t memorize.                                                                               | 
|Password managers    |Password managers can also store credit card numbers, bank account details, national ID numbers, wifi passwords: any important, sensitive piece of data that you can’t remember, but that you might not want to leave lying around. |

|The problem          |The problem is the data remains tied to your browser, so if you create a login on your laptop it won’t be available on your phone or on another laptop.                                                                             |
