|Hi there,            |Hi there, thanks for joining us for Plain English lesson number 333.                                                                                                                                                       | 
|I’m Jeff;            |I’m Jeff; JR is the producer; and this full lesson can be found at PlainEnglish.com/333.                                                                                                                                   | 
|Coming up            |Coming up today: Boeing’s troubled 737-MAX is back.                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The plane            |The plane had been grounded for almost two years following deadly crashes in Asia and Africa.                                                                                                                              | 
|But the              |But the planes have new software and new training and have been approved to fly in two countries.                                                                                                                          | 
|The expression       |The expression today is “in the eyes of.”                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|And on               |And on our video lesson, we talk about how to use the word “besides” to introduce a related point.                                                                                                                         | 
|That’s a             |That’s a good one and available at PlainEnglish.com/333.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Two years            |Two years after Boeing’s 737-MAX was grounded for safety reasons, the modern fuel-efficient regional jet is in the air again.                                                                                              | 
|You’ll remember      |You’ll remember from Lesson 139 that two 737-MAX planes crashed within a short period of time, one in the Indonesia and another in Ethiopia.                                                                               | 
|Almost 350           |Almost 350 people died in those crashes.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Investigations later |Investigations later discovered that in certain cases the plane’s onboard computers were pushing the plane’s nose downward just as pilots were trying to take off.                                                         | 
|The result           |The result was that the pilot, trying to point the plane up, was fighting the plane’s own onboard computer, which was pushing the nose down.                                                                               | 
|The pilots           |The pilots didn’t have enough training on the software, so they didn’t know how to override the computer.                                                                                                                  | 
|An investigation     |An investigation by worldwide aviation authorities discovered that Boeing employees had deceived regulators.                                                                                                               | 
|Pilots would         |Pilots would not need to undergo simulator training, the Boeing employees said, because the changes between the 737-MAX and previous 737’s were not significant.                                                           | 
|Boeing didn’t        |Boeing didn’t want pilots to need extensive training because it would make the planes seem more expensive in the eyes of their customers, the airlines.                                                                    | 
|That deception       |That deception was costly, and not just in lives lost or the blow to Boeing’s reputation.                                                                                                                                  | 
|Earlier this         |Earlier this month, Boeing agreed to pay over $2 billion in fines and victim compensation.                                                                                                                                 | 
|It also              |It also paused manufacturing and designed software and hardware modifications to make the existing 737 Max’s safe again.                                                                                                   | 
|Prior to             |Prior to the plane’s grounding, Boeing had delivered about 350 planes to airlines around the world.                                                                                                                        | 
|It then              |It then finished manufacturing over 450 more planes—but did not deliver them to airlines.                                                                                                                                  | 
|That means           |That means about 800 planes need to be modified.                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Pilots also          |Pilots also need to be trained—thoroughly, this time.                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|So far,              |So far, Brazil and the US have approved the modified 737-MAX to fly again.                                                                                                                                                 | 
|The Brazilian        |The Brazilian airline Gol became the first air carrier to fly the new Max in early December; that flight went between Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre.                                                                          | 
|In the               |In the US, four carriers are set to fly the 737-MAX: American, United, Alaska, and Southwest.                                                                                                                              | 
|All carriers         |All carriers said they would tell passengers in advance that their flight would be aboard a 737-MAX, and any passenger would have the flexibility to change flights for no fee if they’re uncomfortable.                   | 
|The first            |The first flight in the US was on December 29.                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|It was               |It was operated by American Airlines and flew from Miami International Airport to New York’s La Guardia Airport.                                                                                                           | 
|The pilot,           |The pilot, Captain Sean Roskey, said that the aircraft was a 737-MAX in his pre-flight announcements, and many people on the plane started applauding.                                                                     | 
|Of course,           |Of course, with all the publicity, everyone on board the plane already knew!                                                                                                                                               | 
|To boost             |To boost confidence in the aircraft, Captain Roskey’s wife and the first officer’s mother were both on board.                                                                                                              | 
|Robert Isom,         |Robert Isom, the president of American Airlines, was also on board.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The top              |The top official at America’s Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson, took a test flight in September and said he had total confidence in the plane.                                                               | 
|It’s not             |It’s not yet clear whether the public will trust the new 737’s.                                                                                                                                                            | 
|The first            |The first flight leg was full of enthusiasts and airline employees; many were on the flight just to say they were there.                                                                                                   | 
|The return           |The return leg was different.                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|People who           |People who took the return flight from New York to Miami were not as excited to be on a 737-MAX: many were worried and were finding out for the first time at the gate.                                                    | 
|A public             |A public opinion poll showed that 57 percent of Americans would not want to fly on the new 737-MAX.                                                                                                                        | 
|Airlines are         |Airlines are running a reduced schedule due to COVID, so they have the opportunity to reintroduce the plane gradually into their schedules, allowing customers to rebook at another time if they want.                     | 
|Travel by            |Travel by air is one of the safest ways to travel, so it’s likely that after a few months of incident-free flying, the public will embrace the 737-MAX again.                                                              | 
|Besides, airlines    |Besides, airlines have discovered the number one concern their customers have, and it isn’t safety: it’s finding the lowest price.                                                                                         | 
|I think              |I think I’d be comfortable on a 737-MAX.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|You’ve got           |You’ve got to believe that this is the safest airplane in the sky.                                                                                                                                                         | 
|All eyes             |All eyes are on this plane and its safety record.                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|The airlines,        |The airlines, the pilots’ unions, the regulators, Boeing itself—they all have too much at stake.                                                                                                                           | 
|I think              |I think I would be comfortable riding on one—once I start flying again.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|I know               |I know we have pilots in the audience, and we have Brazilian pilots in the audience, so if you’ve got a perspective to share, the place to do that would be the Facebook group for listeners at PlainEnglish.com/Facebook. |
