|Africa is         |Africa is known for its wildlife and extraordinary natural features, and South Africa has its share of both, including one of the best wildlife sanctuaries on the continent: The Kruger National Park, which is both a game reserve and safari destination. | 
|The park          |The park covers a vast area of nearly 2 million hectares.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|To put            |To put it into perspective, it’s approximately two-thirds the size of Belgium.                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|The primary       |The primary purpose of a game reserve is to protect and sustain wildlife and its habitat.                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|However, a        |However, a secondary function of a game reserve is to provide a way for people to explore, discover, and be educated about the animals and their environment.                                                                                                | 
|It’s the          |It’s the best way for humans to see wildlife in its natural habitat, rather than in a zoo.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|What animals      |What animals can you see at Kruger National Park?                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|How about,        |How about, the “Big 5” African mammal species: the African elephant, African lion, Black rhinoceros, African leopard, and Cape buffalo.                                                                                                                      | 
|They got          |They got their name, the Big 5, because they were the most dangerous and difficult animals to hunt on foot.                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Today, they       |Today, they are not hunted in South Africa because their numbers have dwindled drastically, some close to extinction, and they’re protected.                                                                                                                 | 
|But the           |But the name “Big 5” stuck, and visitors try to see all five during their visits to Kruger.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|In fact,          |In fact, it’s common to see all five while driving or walking around the park, but you have to look carefully.                                                                                                                                               | 
|Even a            |Even a large elephant can blend in well with the vegetation.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|The big           |The big cats such as the leopard and the lion can be almost invisible in tall grass, even just a short distance from your vehicle.                                                                                                                           |

|The park          |The park is home to diverse bird species and numerous smaller animals, such as antelopes, impala, zebra, and kudu.                                                                                                                                           | 
|In total,         |In total, the park is home to more than 750 animal species and 2,000 plant species.                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|Speaking of       |Speaking of plants, the northern part of the park boasts the unique Baobab trees.                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|This is           |This is a strange-looking tree with enormous tree trunks, native to Africa and Australia.                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|It is             |It is often called the upside-down tree because of its appearance in winter: the tops of the trees, where the leaves grow, look like roots once the leaves have fallen off.                                                                                  | 
|The park          |The park was first established by Paul Kruger, the president of a South African province, in 1898.                                                                                                                                                           | 
|At the            |At the beginning, the park’s objective was solely to protect the animals.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|It later          |It later merged with a nearby game reserve when South Africa created its system of national parks; that’s when it opened for tourism.                                                                                                                        | 
|The first         |The first three tourist cars paid a small fee of 1 pound each to enter the park in 1927.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|Within a          |Within a decade, about four thousand kilometers of roads had been built, several camps were established, and many more visitors entered the park.                                                                                                            |
