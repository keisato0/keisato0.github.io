|Minutes before    |Minutes before his first broadcast in 1957, the station manager decided he didn’t want “Lawrence Zieger” on the air: that wasn’t a name for show business.                                                                                                                                    | 
|So it             |So it was decided, at the last minute, that Lawrence Zieger would thereafter be Larry King.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Here’s a          |Here’s a funny story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|I was             |I was at the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|The museum        |The museum has a unique layout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|You walk          |You walk in on the ground floor and the exhibits are on ramps that circle the perimeter of the interior.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|So as             |So as you walk through the exhibits, you’re actually walking up the museum, in a spiral pattern, until you get to the top, about the equivalent of seven floors up.                                                                                                                           | 
|And the           |And the whole time you can see down to the lobby and across to the other side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|I was             |I was up on, probably, the fourth floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|And since         |And since it’s a spiral, you can look down at the lobby from almost any point in the museum.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|So I              |So I was up there on the fourth floor and I heard Larry King’s voice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|He had            |He had a voice that you would not mistake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|There is          |There is no other voice like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|I heard           |I heard it and I said, that’s Larry King.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|Remember, this    |Remember, this is the fourth floor of a museum in Mexico City.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|This is           |This is not the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue or the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|But I             |But I heard the voice and I said, that’s Larry King: where is he?                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|And so            |And so I looked down to the lobby and sure enough, there are Larry King and his wife posing for photographs in the lobby.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|That just         |That just shows you how unique his voice was, but also how many times I had heard it over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|I had             |I had probably not heard Larry King’s voice in many years at that point, but it was a voice I would never—will never—forget.                                                                                                                                                                  |
