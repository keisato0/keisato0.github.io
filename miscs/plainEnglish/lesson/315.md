|Coming up          |Coming up today: A COVID vaccine recently completed its Phase III trial and it was shown to be ninety-five percent effective, raising hopes that the end of this pandemic is in sight.                                                                                                           | 
|Speaking of        |Speaking of which “in sight” is the expression we’ll review in the second half of the lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|And JR             |And JR has a song of the week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Pfizer, the        |Pfizer, the global pharmaceutical company, and BioNTech, a relatively young biotech startup, have announced that their COVID vaccine candidate was over 95 percent effective in advanced trials, raising hopes that an effective vaccine could be approved by the end of 2020.                   | 
|Shortly after      |Shortly after the Pfizer news was announced, Moderna, another large pharmaceutical company, announced its vaccine, based on similar technology, was also about 95 percent effective.                                                                                                             | 
|British prime      |British prime minister Boris Johnson, American president-elect Joe Biden, and other national leaders congratulated Pfizer on its news, but were also quick to warn their populations that this is no reason to relax social distancing and ease up on compliance with new lockdown requirements. | 
|Still, the         |Still, the news was undoubtedly good and holds promise that the end of the global pandemic may just be in sight.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|Each vaccine       |Each vaccine uses relatively new genetic technology to build an immune system response to the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|In a               |In a traditional vaccine, a mostly-harmless, low concentration of a relative of the disease is injected into your system—just enough to trigger your body’s defenses, but not enough to make you sick.                                                                                           | 
|It’s a             |It’s a tough balancing act to get that vaccine cocktail right, and many people do still get mild symptoms from traditional vaccines.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|A genetic          |A genetic vaccine takes a different approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|These vaccines     |These vaccines contain special RNA instructions that trick your body into fighting the virus even when it hasn’t had the virus.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Here’s how         |Here’s how it’s supposed to work: each virus has a set of receptor proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|The virus          |The virus uses these proteins to access the inside of your cells, where it can reproduce and make you sick.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The Pfizer         |The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain messenger RNA—or mRNA—that will cause your cells to produce the proteins found on the COVID virus—but only the proteins.                                                                                                                                 | 
|By themselves,     |By themselves, unattached to the virus, these proteins are harmless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|But they           |But they tell a patient’s body that an invader might be present, so the immune system springs into action.                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|A patient’s        |A patient’s immune system begins fighting the virus before the patient is infected.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|Therefore, if      |Therefore, if the patient does get infected later, if the virus does enter the patient’s body, then his or her immune system is already in fighting mode and is able to fight off the virus.                                                                                                     | 
|If the             |If the virus is defeated before it can get into your cells, then the virus cannot reproduce, the patient doesn’t get sick, and the patient doesn’t spread the virus to anyone else.                                                                                                              | 
|That’s the         |That’s the theory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|To test            |To test the theory, Pfizer administered its vaccine to 43,000 people in six countries in a large Phase III trial; that’s more subjects than are normally included in trials.                                                                                                                     | 
|Half the           |Half the participants got the test vaccine; half got a placebo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Pfizer then        |Pfizer then followed up with both sets of participants to see how they were doing after a few weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|Of the             |Of the total population, 94 people got COVID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|The test           |The test group, the group that got the vaccine, represented just ten percent of the COVID illnesses.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|The control        |The control group, the group that got the placebo, represented the vast majority of participants that got sick.                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|From that          |From that data, Pfizer was able to conclude that the vaccine was more than 95 percent effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|They were          |They were able to conclude that, among people who got the true vaccine, 95 percent of probable COVID infections were stopped.                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Moderna’s results  |Moderna’s results were similar, with a similarly large sample size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
