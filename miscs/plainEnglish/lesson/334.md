|Coming up               |Coming up today: You’re probably familiar with Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, Diet Dr.                                                                                                                          |

|Big beverage            |Big beverage makers are getting better and better at mimicking the original in a low-calorie version.                                                                                                   | 
|We take                 |We take them for granted today, but no-calorie soda was not always an option.                                                                                                                           |

|This lesson             |This lesson has been adapted from an article on the web site, The Conversation by Jeffrey Miller, Associate Professor of Hospitality Management at the University of Colorado.                          | 
|In the                  |In the second half of the lesson, we’ll talk about the English expression turn to and we have a quote of the week.                                                                                      | 
|Let’s get               |Let’s get going!                                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The Coca-Cola           |The Coca-Cola company’s original diet soda brand, Tab, is headed to the soda graveyard.                                                                                                                 | 
|Coca-Cola has           |Coca-Cola has announced that it is discontinuing Tab after 57 years on the market, and fans of the drink scrambled to purchase their last can of nostalgia before sales stopped at the end of December. | 
|Tab was                 |Tab was not the first diet soda: that honor belongs to a beverage called (creatively) No-Cal, which was developed by beverage industry pioneer Hyman Kirsch in 1952.                                    | 
|Kirsch wanted           |Kirsch wanted to create a soda for diabetics and people with cardiovascular problems, so he used a chemical called cyclamate.                                                                           | 
|Cylcamate was           |Cylcamate was discovered in 1937 by a graduate student after he licked it and found that it tasted sweet—about 30 times sweeter than sugar, in fact.                                                    | 
|What’s more,            |What’s more, cyclamate isn’t metabolized, making it ideal for people who need to avoid sugar for medical reasons.                                                                                       | 
|But guess               |But guess what?                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|From the                |From the start, No-Cal was popular with a different type of consumer: dieters.                                                                                                                          | 
|Diet soda               |Diet soda really took off with the introduction of Diet-Rite Cola by the Royal Crown Cola company in 1958.                                                                                              | 
|By 1960,                |By 1960, Diet-Rite was the fourth-best-selling soft drink in the country, trailing only Coca-Cola, Pepsi and 7 Up.                                                                                      | 
|Coca-Cola and           |Coca-Cola and Pepsi, finding themselves behind the eight ball, scrambled to come up with their own diet soda offerings.                                                                                 | 
|Coca-Cola’s first       |Coca-Cola’s first foray into the diet cola market was an ambitious one.                                                                                                                                 | 
|The company             |The company called the secret initiative “Project Alpha.”                                                                                                                                               | 
|The objective           |The objective of Project Alpha was to develop a soda that tasted good, had a proper mouthfeel, and was attractive to women, the presumptive market.                                                     | 
|It also                 |It also needed a catchy name.                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|For the                 |For the name, Coke executives had one directive: it couldn’t be called Diet Coke.                                                                                                                       | 
|Early diet              |Early diet sodas didn’t taste great, so companies didn’t want their main brand names associated with the funky taste of diet soda.                                                                      | 
|So “Diet                |So “Diet Coke” was out—for now.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Where did               |Where did Coca-Cola turn to come up with a brilliant name that would appeal to masses of people?                                                                                                        | 
|They turned             |They turned to a computer: an early IBM mainframe computer generated more than 600 potential names.                                                                                                     | 
|The criteria            |The criteria were the following: three or four letters and not offensive in any language.                                                                                                               | 
|Tabb, T-A-B-B,          |Tabb, T-A-B-B, which was eventually shortened to Tab, T-A-B, eventually won the battle of market testing.                                                                                               | 
|It was                  |It was introduced to the world in a series of ads with the tagline “How can just one calorie taste so good?”                                                                                            | 
|Tab got                 |Tab got off to a slow start.                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|By the                  |By the end of its first year, it had only 10% of the diet soda market; it found itself competing with other Coca-Cola diet sodas, including one with a grapefruit flavor.                               | 
|It ran                  |It ran into other troubles.                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|All diet                |All diet sodas relied on artificial sweeteners.                                                                                                                                                         | 
|That’s what             |That’s what gave them a sweet taste with no calories.                                                                                                                                                   | 
|But danger              |But danger was lurking: the sweeteners used in these early formulas were found to have caused cancer.                                                                                                   | 
|In 1969,                |In 1969, America’s Food and Drug Administration banned cyclamate, a key ingredient in Tab.                                                                                                              | 
|Coca-Cola was           |Coca-Cola was forced to reformulate the Tab recipe using saccharine instead.                                                                                                                            | 
|Then in                 |Then in a second blow, the FDA required warning labels on foods with saccharine.                                                                                                                        | 
|Despite these           |Despite these obstacles, Tab still ended up becoming the bestselling diet cola of the 1970s and 1980s.                                                                                                  | 
|People, it              |People, it seems, were willing to turn a blind eye to potential health problems as long as they could continue to get their calorie-free diet soda.                                                     | 
|And Tab,                |And Tab, for a brief period, was the favorite of the bunch.                                                                                                                                             | 
|It was                  |It was only in 1982 that Coca-Cola introduced “Diet Coke,” the soda you can still buy in a silver can today.                                                                                            | 
|Contrary to             |Contrary to the company’s original fears, Diet Coke was an immediate hit.                                                                                                                               |
