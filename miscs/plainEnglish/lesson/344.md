|It’s a             |It’s a tricky question.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |/n
|Vaccine makers     |Vaccine makers have proven, via extensive trials, that their vaccines are effective in preventing symptoms, deaths, and serious cases.                                                                                          |/n
|But it’s           |But it’s still not known if a vaccinated person can catch the disease and spread it to others, even if that person doesn’t show symptoms.                                                                                       |/n
