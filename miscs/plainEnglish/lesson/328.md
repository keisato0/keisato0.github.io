|Coming up                 |Coming up today: Big changes in Hollywood’s business model.                                                                                                                                             | 
|Theater revenue           |Theater revenue was down 70 percent in 2020 and the pandemic has accelerated a trend toward faster streaming releases of movies.                                                                        | 
|That has                  |That has theater owners nervous.                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The expression            |The expression we’ll review today is “cash in on.”                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The video                 |The video lesson online is about how to use “according to”—but not in the typical way we use that phrase.                                                                                               | 
|But first,                |But first, let’s get going with the main lesson.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|For as                    |For as long as people have been going to the movies, one truth has held: a movie from a major studio is shown exclusively in movie theaters.                                                            | 
|Only after                |Only after a suitable waiting period is it available to watch at home.                                                                                                                                  | 
|This enduring             |This enduring truth of Hollywood business—the essential experience of watching a new movie—is under attack.                                                                                             | 
|It’s called               |It’s called the “theatrical window.”                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|It’s a                    |It’s a window of time in which a movie is only available in movie theaters.                                                                                                                             | 
|For almost                |For almost the entire history of moviemaking, the window has served both the studios and the exhibitors.                                                                                                | 
|The exhibitors            |The exhibitors are the movie theater chains and individual theaters.                                                                                                                                    | 
|Studios and               |Studios and theater chains have a love-hate relationship, but they need each other.                                                                                                                     | 
|The majority              |The majority of the money a movie makes comes from theater ticket sales, so the studios need the exhibitors to show the movie on enough screens, sell the tickets to the public, and collect the money. | 
|The exhibitors,           |The exhibitors, obviously, need the studios to provide good movies to attract the crowds.                                                                                                               | 
|Both sides                |Both sides split the ticket revenue, usually according to a heavily-negotiated formula.                                                                                                                 | 
|Of course,                |Of course, both studios and exhibitors can make money in other ways, too.                                                                                                                               | 
|The theaters              |The theaters keep all the money from the high-priced snacks and popcorn.                                                                                                                                | 
|And studios               |And studios can sell their movies in a number of other places: discs, video-on-demand, streaming, and television.                                                                                       | 
|And that                  |And that is where the window comes in.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|The exhibitors—the        |The exhibitors—the movie theaters—know that after a movie is available for streaming, download, or to buy on disc, fans won’t have the same incentive to pay for a movie ticket and attend in theaters. | 
|And the                   |And the exhibitors don’t get to share any of the money from streaming or video-on-demand or discs.                                                                                                      | 
|Therefore, the            |Therefore, the exhibitors and studios negotiated “the window.”                                                                                                                                          | 
|Any moviegoer             |Any moviegoer knows about the window.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|You know                  |You know that if you want to see a brand-new movie from a major studio, you have to see it in the theaters.                                                                                             | 
|If you                    |If you miss it, you might have to wait a long time (usually three or four months) before you can see it at home.                                                                                        | 
|That is                   |That is a powerful incentive to see a movie in a theater, even if you might prefer to stream it.                                                                                                        | 
|Movies are                |Movies are social, even if we watch alone: people like to talk about movies with their friends.                                                                                                         | 
|So if                     |So if you want to see it early, soon after its release, you need to buy a ticket.                                                                                                                       | 
|That serves               |That serves the studios and exhibitors just fine.                                                                                                                                                       | 
|That, however,            |That, however, is all changing.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Prior to                  |Prior to COVID, the window had been inching closed.                                                                                                                                                     | 
|New studios               |New studios like Netflix started releasing films directly to consumers, bypassing theaters.                                                                                                             | 
|Traditional studios       |Traditional studios wanted to cash in on streaming revenues sooner and sooner.                                                                                                                          | 
|Theaters, understandably, |Theaters, understandably, pushed back.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|But then                  |But then COVID hit, closing theaters and leaving studios scrambling to come up with a Plan B.                                                                                                           | 
|For some                  |For some feature films, the strategy was to simply delay release until 2021.                                                                                                                            | 
|New installments          |New installments in the James Bond and Jurassic World franchises were delayed.                                                                                                                          | 
|But some                  |But some studios experimented with other models.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|Warner Brothers           |Warner Brothers announced it would release “Wonder Woman 1984” and all of its 2021 movies on HBO Max the same day they’re available in theaters.                                                        | 
|Disney bypassed           |Disney bypassed theaters entirely when it released its hit “Mulan” straight to its streaming service Disney+ and charged a premium, even for Disney+ subscribers.                                       | 
|In the                    |In the weeks after “Mulan” came out, Disney announced a slew of new content for Disney+, including new Star Wars and Marvel comic book series and a number of feature films.                            | 
|Paramount doesn’t         |Paramount doesn’t have a streaming service, so it sold several films to Netflix and skipped theaters entirely.                                                                                          | 
|In July,                  |In July, Universal came to an agreement with AMC, one of the world’s largest movie theater chains, to shrink the window to just 17 days, or three weekends.                                             | 
|That means                |That means Universal films will be available to download or stream on-demand at home just 17 days after they are released in theaters, though it would give AMC a share of the streaming revenues.      | 
|All this                  |All this is probably good for consumers, who will have more choice about where and when to watch a feature film.                                                                                        | 
|But theaters              |But theaters are understandably spooked.                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Shares of                 |Shares of AMC and Cinemark dropped by about a fifth in the days after the agreement with Universal was announced.                                                                                       | 
|Theater executives        |Theater executives are afraid they are being cut out of the money-making process with new movies.                                                                                                       | 
|Others are                |Others are not quite as pessimistic.                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Theaters might            |Theaters might be able to adapt to a new reality where they show more independent films, older movies, live events, or even rent theaters to groups of friends and family to watch whatever they want.  | 
|One thing                 |One thing that’s bothered me about the current model is that theaters need to prioritize the most popular movies.                                                                                       | 
|So you                    |So you can go to a theater with 20 screens and screens 1 through 16 are playing the same popular movie, with a new showing every 15 minutes.                                                            | 
|Every other               |Every other movie that’s out has to share space in the remaining four screens—not ideal if you don’t want to see the blockbuster, or if you’ve already seen it.                                         | 
|I tend                    |I tend to go to the movies for the experience rather than to see a hit new movie.                                                                                                                       | 
|A lot                     |A lot of the most popular movies aren’t even my style—comic book, super-hero movies just aren’t for me.                                                                                                 | 
|So when                   |So when those come out, there’s nothing for me to see in a theater.                                                                                                                                     | 
|Maybe the                 |Maybe the new window will put less pressure on theaters to squeeze every bit of juice out of the blockbuster and maybe they’ll experiment a little with their schedule.                                 | 
|I can                     |I can only hope!                                                                                                                                                                                        |
