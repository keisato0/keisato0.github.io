|Starbucks is    |Starbucks is accelerating its plans to build more pickup-only locations, where you don’t have to interact with a single human to get your morning coffee.                                                                         | 
|The phrasal     |The phrasal verb we talk about today is “shake up” and we have a song of the week from the 80s.                                                                                                                                   |

|At a            |At a conference last year, Starbucks told investors it would be accelerating its plan toward more pickup-only stores.                                                                                                             | 
|Prior to        |Prior to COVID, Starbucks had been planning to build pickup-only stores over a three- to five-year time period, but the company will compress that timeline to just eighteen months.                                              |

|Years ago,      |Years ago, when Starbucks was making higher-quality coffee popular, it positioned its cafes as a “third place” that you could spend time, in addition to home and the office.                                                     | 
|Its cafés       |Its cafés were designed for either personal or professional time.                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|It would        |It would be common to see a creative on his Macbook, a couple on a date, two businesspeople preparing for a meeting, a group of friends catching up, and a single person reading a book with headphones on—all in the same store. | 
|However, that   |However, that vision masks what Starbucks has become over time.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|In fact,        |In fact, over 80 percent of the tickets in the US are for take-out only.                                                                                                                                                          | 
|Many Starbucks  |Many Starbucks cafés have lines out the door of people waiting for orders.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|To be           |To be honest, that ruins the cozy café vibe, when there are crowds of people standing around and baristas yelling out names and orders.                                                                                           | 
|I lived         |I lived in New York for a few years and I can tell you the majority of Manhattan Starbucks stores are de-facto pickup locations to begin with.                                                                                    | 
|Many of         |Many of the café’s have just a handful of stools, while hundreds of customers come through per hour for their mobile orders or take-out orders.                                                                                   | 
|In the          |In the long run, the new Pickup locations may funnel some traffic out of traditional cafés.                                                                                                                                       | 
|In that         |In that way, they can serve both types of customers better.                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|The Pickup      |The Pickup locations can get an order into the hands of an on-the-go customer faster.                                                                                                                                             | 
|At the          |At the same time, the Pickup locations might draw away some of the foot traffic from the traditional cafés.                                                                                                                       |

|If you’re       |If you’re in the neighborhood, you open the Starbucks app and place a mobile order.                                                                                                                                               |

|Starbucks is    |Starbucks is also experimenting with more suburban locations, drive-through-only locations, while culling some of its urban stores in places like New York.                                                                       |

|The company     |The company is also experimenting with more technology in its existing stores.                                                                                                                                                    |

|Over the        |Over the counter is a huge sign saying, “save time—order on the app.”                                                                                                                                                             | 
|And there’s     |And there’s a long line of people waiting for their app orders, while the traditional line was empty!                                                                                                                             |
