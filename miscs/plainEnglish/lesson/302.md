|On February           |On February 3, 1959, a plane crashed in Clear Lake, Iowa, killing three promising rock and roll musicians.                                                                                                                      | 
|That day              |That day later became known in America as “the day the music died.”                                                                                                                                                             | 
|In Brazil,            |In Brazil, the music died on September 25, 2020, the day that Rio de Janeiro’s League of Samba Schools (LIESA) announced the 2021 Carnival would be postponed indefinitely due to the Covid-19 pandemic.                        | 
|The parade            |The parade organizers decided that it would be too risky to host the event without a vaccine.                                                                                                                                   | 
|It is                 |It is the first time festivities have been canceled since 1912.                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|The Carnival          |The Carnival is a music, dance and cultural festival held each year before Lent, usually at the end of February.                                                                                                                | 
|It is                 |It is one of the world’s largest parties with over two million people in the streets each day.                                                                                                                                  | 
|The official          |The official parade features many of the city’s samba schools performing amid elaborately-designed floats, costumes and sets.                                                                                                   | 
|A samba               |A samba school is a private club of drummers, dancers, musicians and marchers.                                                                                                                                                  | 
|They dance,           |They dance, sing, and perform, hoping to impress a panel of judges, as tens of thousands watch live and millions more watch on television.                                                                                      | 
|Last year,            |Last year, floats included mermaids, people in cowboy costumes, unicorns, elephants, dragons, superheros, and public figures.                                                                                                   | 
|Individuals dressed   |Individuals dressed up—or dressed down—in elaborate costumes, makeup, and hair styles.                                                                                                                                          | 
|The official          |The official parade grounds are in the Sambradrome, a packed exhibition area for the official performances.                                                                                                                     | 
|But the               |But the carnival atmosphere engulfs the city, and features exclusive private parties and anything-goes street festivals.                                                                                                        | 
|Hundreds of           |Hundreds of small parties, called blocos, break out across the city, some of them with thousands of partiers each.                                                                                                              | 
|For most              |For most people, Carnival is a party and a celebration: for others, it’s a livelihood.                                                                                                                                          | 
|The announcement      |The announcement dealt a tragic blow to the many people who make their living preparing for the world’s biggest party.                                                                                                          | 
|They are              |They are the costume designers, carpenters, sculptors, jewelry makers, security guards, restaurant and bar owners, and many others that make a large part of their annual income from preparing for, and serving, the festival. | 
|In addition           |In addition to the party, Carnival is also a time to make political commentary—and skewer the people in power.                                                                                                                  | 
|That would            |That would have been especially welcome this year, as people are frustrated with the government’s handling of the pandemic.                                                                                                     | 
|Revelers will         |Revelers will be deprived of the opportunity to express their opinions in their traditional Brazilian fashion.                                                                                                                  | 
|The question          |The question now is, what is going to happen between February 12 and February 17 in Rio?                                                                                                                                        | 
|With the              |With the official parade off, will the city still heave with visitors and revelers—or will people stay inside and respect social distance?                                                                                      | 
|Individual samba      |Individual samba schools—despite the name, samba schools are samba clubs or organizations, not instructional schools—the individual samba schools are keeping their options open.                                               | 
|They may              |They may choose to perform individually, away from the official parade grounds, and they may visit the street parties that typically pop up.                                                                                    | 
|Some people           |Some people have said that the only responsible thing to do is to cancel the parties, and that samba schools are acting in a more responsible manner than the country’s government leaders.                                     | 
|Others say            |Others say that Carnival lives inside everyone—and that people will find a way to party, regardless of the official parade or guidance.                                                                                         | 
|Rio’s government      |Rio’s government will have to decide how much of the informal street parties it will allow this year.                                                                                                                           | 
|The city’s            |The city’s tourism agency, responsible for promoting Carnival to travelers around the world, said that it would be hard to promote a party like that without a vaccine.                                                         | 
|Each year,            |Each year, Rio’s Carnival attracts over 2 million visitors and generates $725 million in tourism spending.                                                                                                                      | 
|São Paulo,            |São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, canceled its Carnival in July.                                                                                                                                                                |
