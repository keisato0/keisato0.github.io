|Hi there,          |Hi there, get ready for another Plain English lesson; I’m Jeff, JR is the producer, and this is lesson 322.                                                                                                                             | 
|And you            |And you can see the full lesson at PlainEnglish.com/322.                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Coming up          |Coming up today: The UK was the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the novel coronavirus; Canada was second; the US came days later; and approval is expected soon in Europe, Australia, and other countries. | 
|And so             |And so starts the biggest vaccination effort in world history.                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|Today we’ll        |Today we’ll talk about the complicated path a vaccine will take from the factory door and into (hopefully) your arm.                                                                                                                    | 
|As 2020            |As 2020 comes to a close, all eyes are on two small towns: Puurs, Belgium, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the United States.                                                                                                               | 
|Puurs is           |Puurs is best known for producing the strong Belgian Duvel beer.                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|Kalamazoo is       |Kalamazoo is home to Gibson guitars.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|But now            |But now those two towns share the spotlight at the center of a scientific breakthrough: they are where Pfizer is manufacturing the first doses of its coronavirus vaccine.                                                              | 
|The two            |The two facilities are expected to produce 50 million doses by the end of 2020, and the 171-year-old Pfizer says they’ll produce over a billion doses in 2021.                                                                          | 
|When the           |When the vaccine leaves the factory door, it goes on a long and complicated journey before it can be injected into a patient’s arm.                                                                                                     | 
|It’s all           |It’s all based on a “just-in-time” manufacturing system, which aims to ship the vaccine where it’s needed, when it’s needed, and without spending any unnecessary time in a warehouse.                                                  | 
|That’s critical    |That’s critical because this vaccine must be kept between -70 and -84 degrees Celsius until just days before it’s administered to a patient.                                                                                            | 
|This critical      |This critical requirement means that distribution of the vaccine must go through a cold chain—a supply chain equipped to keep the vaccine cold enough, for long enough.                                                                 | 
|The vaccine        |The vaccine loses its effectiveness quickly if it’s outside a narrow range of temperatures.                                                                                                                                             | 
|The vaccines       |The vaccines leave Pfizer’s factories packed in re-usable super-cold refrigeration units.                                                                                                                                               | 
|All units          |All units are equipped with temperature and location sensors, allowing the company to monitor their progress.                                                                                                                           | 
|If a               |If a shipment has been out too long, or if it leaves the temperature range, then Pfizer can proactively take that shipment out of the supply chain.                                                                                     | 
|Pfizer intends     |Pfizer intends to ship the majority of its vaccine doses by air to regional distribution hubs, and then by truck to individual hospitals and clinics.                                                                                   | 
|When the           |When the vaccine leaves the Michigan factory, it goes in unmarked trucks to airports, where one of three carriers will bring it to the world: UPS, FedEx, and DHL.                                                                      | 
|The first          |The first doses from Belgium are being trucked straight to the UK through the Channel Tunnel, which connects England and France.                                                                                                        | 
|Shipments will     |Shipments will go to other countries as they begin to approve the vaccine.                                                                                                                                                              | 
|Some regional      |Some regional hospitals have the ultra-cold refrigerators needed to maintain the temperature range of the vaccine.                                                                                                                      | 
|At those           |At those locations, the vaccine can be transferred from the Pfizer container to the freezer.                                                                                                                                            | 
|But the            |But the majority of smaller hospitals, clinics and pharmacies don’t have those capabilities.                                                                                                                                            | 
|So Pfizer          |So Pfizer designed its own container to maintain its vaccines at the appropriate temperature.                                                                                                                                           | 
|Vials containing   |Vials containing the vaccine concentrate are packed into flax boxes that resemble pizza boxes, with 195 vials each.                                                                                                                     | 
|Five of            |Five of those are packed together in one single container, topped with 50 pounds of dry ice.                                                                                                                                            | 
|The whole          |The whole thing weighs 80 pounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|The vaccine        |The vaccine can survive in those containers for 30 days, as long as the dry ice is refilled every five days.                                                                                                                            | 
|Local clinics      |Local clinics remove the vials when they’re almost ready to administer them; they then return the box to Pfizer to be reused.                                                                                                           | 
|Once the           |Once the vaccines are removed from the box, they can survive for five days at a normal refrigerated temperature.                                                                                                                        | 
|That gives         |That gives clinics a little flexibility in how many doses they administer per day—a little.                                                                                                                                             | 
|They will          |They will need to carefully plan the number of people who come in for their vaccines each day to avoid any being spoiled.                                                                                                               | 
|As if              |As if that’s not complicated enough, there’s additional preparation needed in the hours before a vaccine can be administered to a patient.                                                                                              | 
|Each dose          |Each dose comes in concentrated form.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|It has             |It has to be diluted with a saline solution: each individual glass vial of the vaccine concentrate produces five doses of the vaccine.                                                                                                  | 
|Once thawed        |Once thawed and diluted, a vaccine must be administered within six hours.                                                                                                                                                               | 
|Pfizer is          |Pfizer is also sending out kits of supplies ahead of the vaccine itself.                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Kits including     |Kits including syringes, alcohol wipes, and instructions are being shipped separately.                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Dry ice            |Dry ice will also be shipped to locations that don’t have super-cold freezers.                                                                                                                                                          | 
|Airlines and       |Airlines and shipping firms are gearing up to meet the distribution challenge; some passenger planes will be repurposed to carry the vaccine cargo.                                                                                     | 
|Around the         |Around the world, doctors, nurses, and health care workers are preparing for the challenge at their end of the supply chain.                                                                                                            | 
|They’re practicing |They’re practicing handling the vaccine, maintaining its temperature, and using their own personal protective equipment.                                                                                                                | 
|In the             |In the first wave, two vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer will have two sets of handling instructions—two sets of instructions for health care workers to follow.                                                                         | 
|Hospitals and      |Hospitals and clinics are setting up staging areas, where they’ll manage the flow of patients—and information.                                                                                                                          | 
|This last          |This last part is critically important, because both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need to be administered in two doses: every patient needs to come back for a second dose exactly 21 days after the first one.                      | 
|That means         |That means distributors need to take careful records of which patients receive which vaccine and when, so they can get the correct booster shot at the correct time.                                                                    |

|The development    |The development of a vaccine is a total mystery to me, so I can appreciate it only in a general sense.                                                                                                                                  |
