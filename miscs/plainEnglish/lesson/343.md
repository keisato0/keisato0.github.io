|Coming up          |Coming up on today’s lesson: Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com from his home in Seattle in 1994; that business made him the world’s richest man.                                                                                           | 
|Now he             |Now he has decided to semi-retire from Amazon; I’ll explain what, exactly, I mean by that.                                                                                                                                             | 
|The phrasal        |The phrasal verb today is “step back from” and JR has a song of the week.                                                                                                                                                              | 
|Jeff Bezos,        |Jeff Bezos, the world’s second-richest man, announced that he will step back from his duties as Chief Executive Officer of Amazon, the e-commerce behemoth he founded at his home in 1994.                                             | 
|The company        |The company announced last month that the 57-year-old Bezos would transition to executive chairman.                                                                                                                                    | 
|As such            |As such , he will remain involved in the strategic decision-making of the company, more so than other members of the Board of Directors, but he won’t be in charge of day-to-day operations as CEO.                                    | 
|That role          |That role will fall to 53-year-old Andy Jassy.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|Only two           |Only two exceptions to that rule come to mind: Bezos’s divorce and the HQ2 debacle.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|A few              |A few years ago, Amazon announced it would build a second headquarters somewhere in the United States, and invited cities to compete for the privilege of hosting its second headquarters, or “HQ2.”                                   | 
|It was             |It was a public relations disaster.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Mayors around      |Mayors around the US bowed before Amazon and begged it to come to their cities.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|They spent         |They spent millions of dollars on proposals and offered Amazon billions of dollars in special tax breaks.                                                                                                                              | 
|In the             |In the end, Amazon punted and chose two cities: New York and the suburbs of Washington, DC.                                                                                                                                            | 
|It then            |It then backed out of its commitment to New York after the city threatened to reduce some of the tax benefits it had offered.                                                                                                          | 
|It was             |It was a blow to the company’s reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|Bezos himself      |Bezos himself took a backseat role during the HQ2 fiasco, but he was the center of the other notable Amazon controversy of recent years: a very public divorce from his well-liked wife, Mackenzie, who helped in Amazon’s early days. | 
|The controversy    |The controversy also included an affair, a model, tabloid magazines, threats of blackmail, and explicit photos.                                                                                                                        | 
|The company        |The company survived both those embarrassments.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
