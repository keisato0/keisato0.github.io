|Today, dog         |Today, dog and cat owners often sleep in their own beds with their pets and treat them to organic, minimally processed (expensive) food.                                                                      | 
|They have          |They have toys and stimulation; special schools; public parks and beaches have designated pet areas.                                                                                                          | 
|Pet health         |Pet health insurance is popular so that ageing pets can have expensive operations or prescriptions if they get sick.                                                                                          | 
|In America,        |In America, almost half of pet owners buy their pets birthday gifts.                                                                                                                                          | 
|I have             |I have long maintained that if you want to make a lot of money in America, you should get into the pet industry: Americans well spend ridiculous amounts of money on their pets.                              | 
|I’ve used          |I’ve used the term “pet ownership,” and that is the most common way to describe someone who has a pet: that person is a pet “owner.”                                                                          | 
|But lately         |But lately some people have taken to calling themselves “pet parents.”                                                                                                                                        | 
|You might          |You might hear someone say he’s a “dog dad.”                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|And indeed         |And indeed as people delay having children until later in life, many couples use pets as a stepping stone toward parenthood.                                                                                  | 
|But for            |But for the ultimate in pet humanization, look to South Korea.                                                                                                                                                | 
|There, cats        |There, cats don’t have owners.                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Cats have          |Cats have “butlers.”                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|That’s right:      |That’s right: the people who have cats in South Korea call themselves the cats’ butlers.                                                                                                                      | 
|In America,        |In America, we raise our pets to be our equals in our families; in South Korea, they raise their cats up so they are superior to the humans: the humans are the butlers!                                      | 
|There are          |There are many good reasons to have a pet.                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Pets provide       |Pets provide emotional support and reduce anxiety in times of stress, especially like what we’ve been living through lately.                                                                                  | 
|Playing with       |Playing with pets is a great way for people to get exercise: taking dogs for walks has health benefits for both the dog and the walker.                                                                       | 
|Many people        |Many people find that caring for pets gives them purpose, is personally rewarding, and helps them socialize with other humans.                                                                                | 
|Studies often      |Studies often find that dog ownership is associated with better recoveries from events like stroke and heart attacks.                                                                                         | 
|Seniors who        |Seniors who care for pets make fewer doctor’s visits.                                                                                                                                                         | 
|It’s hard          |It’s hard to prove whether pet, or especially dog, ownership is truly the cause of better health outcomes, or whether healthier people are more likely to have pets.                                          | 
|But pet            |But pet ownership is generally associated with healthier people.                                                                                                                                              |

|Just walking       |Just walking around the city, I’d often see dog walkers with three, sometimes four dogs at a time.                                                                                                            |
