|As part                    |As part of my job, I would travel most weeks to at least one other city, sometimes two or even three other places in the same week, sometimes interrupted by thunderstorms, snowstorms, changes in schedule, canceled flights, flights diverted to other airports, and all the other hassles of regular business travel. |

|He was                     |He was on his way home to India, but was too afraid to continue his journey, so he stayed within the security zone of the airport until he was caught in late January.                                                                                                                                                   | 
|He spent                   |He spent his days in the gate areas and wandering the vast terminal concourses of one of the world’s biggest airports.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|The security               |The security checkpoints are closed between 11 pm and 4:30 am, but the inside—the secure area—never closes because flights arrive late and leave early.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|For that                   |For that reason, the gate areas never technically close—airport employees never sweep through and ask people to leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|It’s true                  |It’s true what that other passenger said, though, about feeling invisible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|O’Hare is                  |O’Hare is a busy airport, and it’s very big, but it’s not that big.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The corridors              |The corridors are long, but when it’s empty late at night, it’s very quiet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|It’s an                    |It’s an eerie feeling being there past midnight, in one of the world’s biggest transportation hubs, and it feels like nobody’s around—it’s silent except for the white noise of announcements, air conditioning, doors opening and closing in the distance, a machine beeping here and there.                            | 
|But it’s                   |But it’s quiet late at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|There are                  |There are people walking around—cleaning crews, people closing up restaurants, security, obviously airport employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|And that                   |And that other passenger is right—even when there are few people, nobody really makes eye contact, nobody really notices you.                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|If you’re                  |If you’re dressed in a presentable manner and if you look like a traveler, people will leave you alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
