|Coming up           |Coming up today: Face masks are essential for public health during these times of coronavirus.                                                                                                  |/n

|Wearing cloth       |Wearing cloth or paper face masks is now the norm in dozens of countries around the world: it’s essential to stop the spread of the coronavirus.                                                |/n
|For many            |For many of us, and I’ll count myself in that, it’s our first time wearing a protective face mask in public.                                                                                    |/n

|Wearing a           |Wearing a mask can make it hard to connect with other people—colleagues, good friends, and even strangers.                                                                                      |/n
|A mask              |A mask presents two principal barriers to communication: first, it’s harder to understand someone’s voice clearly; and second, it’s much more difficult to read facial expressions.             |/n
|Voices come         |Voices come out muffled, so speakers strain to be heard and listeners strain to understand.                                                                                                     |/n
|That usually        |That usually means that speakers talk louder than normal, and their words lose some of the intonation that conveys meaning.                                                                     |/n

|The most            |The most direct form of meaning comes through words, but people communicate emotions through intonation, too.                                                                                   |/n
|Intonation can      |Intonation can turn a genuine sentence sarcastic; it can add empathy or surprise; it can warn another person to be careful: in short, intonation can increase the power of our words.           |/n
|The trouble         |The trouble is, it’s harder to add the right emotion to your voice when you’re speaking loudly: just try expressing empathy or understanding at a high volume.                                  |/n
|It’s almost         |It’s almost impossible.                                                                                                                                                                         |/n

|Reading lips        |Reading lips and facial expressions also helps when understanding conversation in a second language.                                                                                            |/n
