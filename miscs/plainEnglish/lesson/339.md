|One unexpected      |One unexpected side effect of wearing a face mask: it can be hard to read facial expressions.                                                                                                   | 
|Hi there            |Hi there everyone, it’s Jeff, and thanks for joining us for another Plain English lesson.                                                                                                       | 
|I do                |I do sincerely appreciate that you choose to spend a part of your week listening to me in English, I think that’s really great.                                                                 | 
|JR is               |JR is the producer and he has posted the full lesson online at PlainEnglish.com/339.                                                                                                            | 
|Coming up           |Coming up today: Face masks are essential for public health during these times of coronavirus.                                                                                                  | 
|But they            |But they can make communication difficult—and not just because it’s hard to hear someone talking with a mask on.                                                                                | 
|They block          |They block our facial expressions.                                                                                                                                                              | 
|So on               |So on today’s lesson, we’ll talk about how we communicate with our faces—and how we can compensate for having half our faces covered up.                                                        | 
|The expression      |The expression is “get away with” and JR has a song of the week.                                                                                                                                | 
|Wearing cloth       |Wearing cloth or paper face masks is now the norm in dozens of countries around the world: it’s essential to stop the spread of the coronavirus.                                                | 
|For many            |For many of us, and I’ll count myself in that, it’s our first time wearing a protective face mask in public.                                                                                    | 
|The physical        |The physical sensation of wearing a mask was strange at first, but most people can get used to that in just a few weeks.                                                                        | 
|The harder          |The harder adjustment, though, is interpersonal relationships.                                                                                                                                  | 
|Wearing a           |Wearing a mask can make it hard to connect with other people—colleagues, good friends, and even strangers.                                                                                      | 
|A mask              |A mask presents two principal barriers to communication: first, it’s harder to understand someone’s voice clearly; and second, it’s much more difficult to read facial expressions.             | 
|Voices come         |Voices come out muffled, so speakers strain to be heard and listeners strain to understand.                                                                                                     | 
|That usually        |That usually means that speakers talk louder than normal, and their words lose some of the intonation that conveys meaning.                                                                     | 
|Speech is           |Speech is full of meaning.                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The most            |The most direct form of meaning comes through words, but people communicate emotions through intonation, too.                                                                                   | 
|Intonation can      |Intonation can turn a genuine sentence sarcastic; it can add empathy or surprise; it can warn another person to be careful: in short, intonation can increase the power of our words.           | 
|The trouble         |The trouble is, it’s harder to add the right emotion to your voice when you’re speaking loudly: just try expressing empathy or understanding at a high volume.                                  | 
|It’s almost         |It’s almost impossible.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Individuals with    |Individuals with hearing problems read lips and facial expressions more than others.                                                                                                            | 
|About five          |About five percent of the world’s population suffers from hearing loss.                                                                                                                         | 
|Reading lips        |Reading lips and facial expressions also helps when understanding conversation in a second language.                                                                                            | 
|Even more           |Even more than our voices, our faces tell a rich story.                                                                                                                                         | 
|Scientists say      |Scientists say that humans are the only animals that rely heavily on facial expressions to communicate.                                                                                         | 
|In fact,            |In fact, people place more reliance on what they see rather than in what they hear.                                                                                                             | 
|One study           |One study found that when there’s a difference in meaning between the words that are spoken and the facial expressions of the speaker, people believe the facial expressions and not the words. | 
|Facial expressions  |Facial expressions are harder to fake.                                                                                                                                                          | 
|Take your           |Take your smile, for example.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|I don’t             |I don’t know about you, but I cannot fake a smile.                                                                                                                                              | 
|I’ve given          |I’ve given up trying: it just doesn’t look good.                                                                                                                                                | 
|If you              |If you catch me smiling, then you know the emotion is real.                                                                                                                                     | 
|And the             |And the emotion behind a smile isn’t just happiness.                                                                                                                                            | 
|Studies have        |Studies have shown that there are 19 different types of smiles.                                                                                                                                 | 
|A smile             |A smile is most often associated with happiness, but only six of the 19 types of smiles convey forms of happiness.                                                                              | 
|Others convey       |Others convey fear, embarrassment, pain, skepticism, disbelief, and other emotions.                                                                                                             | 
|But face            |But face masks obscure so much of this communication, and they can have detrimental side effects.                                                                                               | 
|Effectively reading |Effectively reading a smile or other facial expression helps humans know whom to trust.                                                                                                         | 
|It stands           |It stands to reason, then, that if we can’t read facial expressions, it’s harder to build trust with strangers.                                                                                 | 
|Superficial or      |Superficial or transactional interactions are probably unaffected.                                                                                                                              | 
|Being masked        |Being masked as you shop for groceries or get a haircut is inconvenient, but probably doesn’t have much effect on the outcome.                                                                  | 
|However, other      |However, other interactions are more important.                                                                                                                                                 | 
|For example,        |For example, a 2013 study sought to measure whether patients perceived doctors differently if those doctors wore protective face masks when speaking.                                           | 
|The result?         |The result?                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|Patients had        |Patients had less trust in doctors that wore face masks.                                                                                                                                        | 
|That’s because      |That’s because sincerity, trustworthiness and good intentions are communicated non-verbally.                                                                                                    | 
|So if               |So if we know that face masks are blocking more than just our germs, is there anything we can do to compensate for this barrier to communication?                                               | 
|Here are            |Here are a few tips for communicating while wearing a mask.                                                                                                                                     | 
|Some of             |Some of these, by the way, come from women who wear face coverings in public for religious reasons—they’re already a step ahead of the rest of us.                                              | 
|First, pay          |First, pay close attention to your voice.                                                                                                                                                       | 
|Make sure           |Make sure you’re speaking loud enough, and try to accentuate the words you want to emphasize, even more than you would normally do.                                                             | 
|It can              |It can sometimes feel uncomfortable to purposely speak with more vocal inflection than you’re used to.                                                                                          | 
|But you             |But you can probably get away with much more vocal inflection than you think you can.                                                                                                           | 
|Next, think         |Next, think about when you’re not talking.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|A conversation      |A conversation is fluid when everyone knows when they can talk.                                                                                                                                 | 
|Believe it          |Believe it or not , you often take your clue to jump into a conversation from the other person’s lips.                                                                                          | 
|If your             |If your conversation partner can’t read your lips, he or she won’t know when it’s okay to talk.                                                                                                 | 
|So you              |So you can pause more often to give the other person permission to take a turn in the conversation.                                                                                             | 
|You can             |You can also use gestures and body language more than normal.                                                                                                                                   | 
|You can             |You can give an animated wave, a thumbs-up, a raised eyebrow, an outstretched hand.                                                                                                             | 
|Raise your          |Raise your eyebrows and open your eyes wide to communicate a smile.                                                                                                                             | 
|In a                |In a business or more formal setting, be more explicit with your words.                                                                                                                         | 
|Don’t assume        |Don’t assume the other person knows when you’re being sarcastic, or when you’re making a joke.                                                                                                  | 
|I know              |I know jokes aren’t as funny when you have to over-explain them, but it’s better to over-communicate with words than to be misunderstood.                                                       | 
|I’ll tell           |I’ll tell you why I wrote about this.                                                                                                                                                           | 
|I was               |I was at the gym the other day—the gym and the grocery store are the only two places I go—and on my way out, I said thank you to the people at the front desk.                                  | 
|The words,          |The words, “thank you,” by themselves, just the words, are almost meaningless because they’re so common.                                                                                        | 
|People say          |People say “thank you” when they don’t mean it, or because they feel they have to say it.                                                                                                       | 
|But I               |But I was being genuine and was smiling beneath my mask—and I realized that nobody was there to see that smile.                                                                                 | 
|So I                |So I started saying thank you and waving, which is not something I would ever do pre-mask.                                                                                                      | 
|And that’s          |And that’s how I got to thinking about this topic—my smile was getting lost.                                                                                                                    |
