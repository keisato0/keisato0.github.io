|They’re famous                 |They’re famous for their hash browns, which are shredded potatoes cooked on the skillet, so they’re crunchy, brown, and buttery when they arrive in a huge pile on your plate.                                                |

|Just north                     |Just north of Waffle House territory is the Queen City: Cincinnati, Ohio.                                                                                                                                                     |

|At Skyline,                    |At Skyline, the chili is a watery brown liquid, and they pour it over a plate of spaghetti (not sure why), and top it all off with a mound of shredded cheddar cheese.                                                        | 
|If you                         |If you don’t like it that way, you can have the chili and cheese on top of a mini hot dog; those are called Coney’s.                                                                                                          | 
|They love                      |They love their Skyline Chili in Cincinnati: there are a handful in Cleveland, a few in Indianapolis, but if you want this special blend of cinnamon-flavored chili over spaghetti, you’ll have to have it in the Queen City. | 
|Time to                        |Time to go north again, we’re going all the way  up to Wisconsin.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|Wisconsin is                   |Wisconsin is nicknamed “America’s Dairyland” because of all the milk and cheese they produce; fans of the local football team even call themselves “Cheeseheads.”                                                             | 
|So if                          |So if you’re in Wisconsin and you go to the local chain restaurant Culver’s, you need to get fried cheese curds.                                                                                                              | 
|Cheese curds                   |Cheese curds are what cheese looks like before it’s processed; they’re great fresh, right out of a bag, but if you go to Culver’s, you can get them battered and fried, too.                                                  | 
|If you’re                      |If you’re there, you should also get the Wisconsin-style of ice cream; it’s called custard, and it’s a little thicker than soft-serve ice cream, but thinner than traditional ice cream.                                      | 
|They can                       |They can mix it up with all kinds of toppings—fruit, nuts, candy, whatever you like.                                                                                                                                          | 
|Culver’s is                    |Culver’s is in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and a few in Illinois, but they’re most popular in Wisconsin.                                                                                                                          |

|The name                       |The name says it all: it’s burgers, and because it’s Texas, there’s a little bit of a Mexican flavor to it.                                                                                                                   | 
|They have                      |They have jalapeño burgers, poblano pepper chicken tacos, and they even serve spicy ketchup.                                                                                                                                  | 
|That’s the                     |That’s the famous burger chain Texas, but that’s not the most famous and most popular burger regional chain in America.                                                                                                       |

|It was                         |It was popular to drive up, order from the kitchen, and either eat in your car or sit outside at a picnic table and eat.                                                                                                      |

|Today, many                    |Today, many of them have dining rooms to sit down and eat inside, but the drive-thru is still popular at In-n-Out Burger today.                                                                                               |

|Fans of                        |Fans of the restaurant willingly put In-n-Out bumper stickers on their cars, they wear sweatshirts with the company’s logo, and post selfies on social media.                                                                 | 
|Despite its                    |Despite its popularity, In-n-Out Burger is not franchised, meaning that the company owns all its own stores.                                                                                                                  |
