|Coming up            |Coming up today: it wasn’t exactly the birthday celebration the classical music world had planned, but this week a concert in Bonn, Germany, will commemorate 250 years since the birth of Ludwig van Beethoven, one of the best classical composers ever to live.                | 
|Today’s lesson       |Today’s lesson will be about Beethoven’s life and the adaptations the classical world has had to make due to the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The phrasal          |The phrasal verb is “burn through;” I’ve got a couple of good examples of that—the examples are about startup companies, airlines, and pro athletes.                                                                                                                              | 
|And we               |And we have a quote of the week from Beethoven himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Quick: who’s         |Quick: who’s the greatest composer of all time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|If you               |If you ask this question to people familiar with classical symphonies, piano sonatas or string quartets, chances are you’ll get one of three names: Mozart, Bach or Ludwig van Beethoven.                                                                                         | 
|Ludwig van           |Ludwig van Beethoven was baptized on December 17, 1770—his exact birthday is unknown, but it’s almost definitely this week, 250 years ago exactly.                                                                                                                                | 
|That makes           |That makes him sixteen years younger than Mozart and 85 years younger than Bach.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Mozart was           |Mozart was famously a child prodigy, but Beethoven is classical music’s most vivid character.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|His life             |His life was characterized by a series of trials, from professional to personal.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Famously, Beethoven  |Famously, Beethoven was blessed with a singular musical talent but cursed with debilitating hearing loss.                                                                                                                                                                         |

|In his               |In his early twenties, he left for the rich musical culture of Vienna, Austria.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|But it               |But it wasn’t smooth sailing, for just as he was preparing to establish himself as a professional musician, his hearing started to fail him.                                                                                                                                      |

|Just six             |Just six years later, in 1808, already a respected musician, he conducted a four-hour concert that debuted two symphonies and a piano concerto, winning accolades from the highest levels of European musical culture and cementing his reputation as a great classical composer. | 
|He was               |He was recognized and patronized by European royalty and commanded premium prices for his compositions and his concerts.                                                                                                                                                          |
