|Coming up          |Coming up today: left-handedness in the human and animal worlds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|We’ll explore      |We’ll explore some of the ways that’s true, and also talk about left-handedness in nature and in history.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|About ten          |About ten percent of the people listening to this lesson are left-handed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|If you’re          |If you’re one of them, then you know that lefties unfortunately often have to adapt to a world built by and for righties.                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|The physical       |The physical world caters to the approximately 90 percent of people who are right-handed, in ways that might surprise you if you’re part of the majority.                                                                                                                                              | 
|One of             |One of the earliest disadvantages lefties encounter comes in school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|I’m not            |I’m not sure how it is where you are, but in many American classrooms, there’s a design of desk that’s particularly cruel to lefties.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|These space-saving |These space-saving desks are attached to the chairs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|While that’s       |While that’s probably not good for anyone’s posture, it’s especially inconvenient for left-handed students.                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|That’s because     |That’s because that style of desk has an armrest on the right, where you rest your arm as you’re writing.                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|If you             |If you write with your left hand, you’ll have difficulty writing because you have to hold your elbow up.                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|And if             |And if you’re writing in a spiral notebook with the rings on the left, then you’re really in trouble.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|It’s not           |It’s not just kids at a disadvantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|The grown-up       |The grown-up world is full of everyday items built by, and for, righties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|The next           |The next time you open a can of soup, veggies, or tuna, pause for a second and be thankful that you’re a rightie.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|That’s because     |That’s because a standard can opener is difficult, if not dangerous, for a left-handed person to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|The standard       |The standard can opener is meant to be held in your left hand, while you use your right, or dominant, hand to turn the knob clockwise.                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|The natural        |The natural movement is totally opposite for lefties; to use a standard can opener, they have to reach over the can with their left hand.                                                                                                                                                              | 
|It’s similar       |It’s similar with standard scissors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Other things       |Other things are just awkward, like swiping a credit card, opening the zipper on a pair of jeans, using the cupholders in the center console of a car, typing numbers on the right-hand side of a standard keyboard, using a standard mouse, or trying to read the numbers of a standard tape measure. | 
|As with            |As with many things in human nature, the dominance of your right or left hand falls on a spectrum; it’s not simply binary.                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|The Edinburgh      |The Edinburgh handedness inventory was invented in 1971.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|It’s a             |It’s a scale that’s used to measure the dominance of the right and left hand in everyday activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|As humans          |As humans evolved, we built these skills, so the left side of our brains grew over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|Perhaps that’s     |Perhaps that’s why the right side slowly would have become more dominant in the population over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|If that’s          |If that’s true, then why are we not all right-handed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|There is           |There is a theory about why left-handedness still exists in a fraction of the population, which is based on one word: combat, or physical fighting.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Right-handers have |Right-handers have a hard time fighting against left-handers, giving lefties a bit of an advantage in physical confrontations.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Over time,         |Over time, that might have led to reproductive success—just enough to keep left-handedness in the population.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
