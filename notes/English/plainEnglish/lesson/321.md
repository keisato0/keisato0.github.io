|Like Monday’s         |Like Monday’s lesson about Beethoven, this will be about an outsized figure that had his ups and downs in life.                                                                                               |

|If you                |If you ask an Argentine of a certain age who is the best soccer player in history, the answer is likely to be Diego Maradona.                                                                                 |

|When he               |When he was just eight years old, he was spotted by a talent scout while playing soccer for his neighborhood club.                                                                                            |

|In professional       |In professional soccer, club teams can trade, or transfer, players and the acquiring team usually pays a fee for the privilege.                                                                               | 
|New clubs             |New clubs are willing to pay a premium to acquire the best players.                                                                                                                                           | 
|After a               |After a few years with the Boca Juniors, Barcelona paid a then-world record 5 million-euro transfer fee.                                                                                                      | 
|Just a                |Just a few years later, Napoli, in Naples, Italy, would acquire Maradona, breaking the transfer-fee record again.                                                                                             |

|In 1991,              |In 1991, his lifestyle caught up with him: he tested positive for cocaine and was banned from soccer for 15 months; later that year, he was charged with drug trafficking.                                    | 
|He returned,          |He returned, but that would not be his last brush with drug-related controversy.                                                                                                                              |
