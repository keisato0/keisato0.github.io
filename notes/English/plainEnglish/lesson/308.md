|You’ll want     |You’ll want to take a black marker—it can be any color, just not orange—take a marker and draw a face on the front of the pumpkin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Don’t get       |Don’t get too fancy at this stage, especially if it’s your first pumpkin because you’re going to have to carve this with a knife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|So I            |So I would recommend sticking with triangles for eyes and the nose, and then a wide mouth, maybe with a few big triangle teeth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|And now         |And now from the outside, you’ll use a knife to carve the shape of the face that you’ve drawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
