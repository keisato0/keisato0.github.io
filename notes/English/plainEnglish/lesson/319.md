|Cyber Monday         |Cyber Monday and the history of online holiday shopping.                                                                                                                                                       |

|Coming up            |Coming up today: where did the term Cyber Monday come from, and what does it mean?                                                                                                                             | 
|It’s a               |It’s a worldwide phenomenon—not one of America’s best cultural exports, in my opinion, but nonetheless a worldwide phenomenon.                                                                                 | 
|I’ll talk            |I’ll talk about where the term comes from today.                                                                                                                                                               | 
|I decided            |I decided to take a holiday from researching serious topics, so this is the second lesson I wrote over the American Thanksgiving weekend.                                                                      | 
|The phrasal          |The phrasal verb today is “back up” in the sense of supporting a claim.                                                                                                                                        | 
|And we               |And we have a song of the week—and a bonus book recommendation, too.                                                                                                                                           | 
|I don’t              |I don’t do that a lot, but listen up and you’ll hear it.                                                                                                                                                       | 
|The first            |The first thing you need to know about “Cyber Monday” is the word “cyberspace.”                                                                                                                                | 
|This was             |This was the original, invented word to describe the online world, back when the Internet was first being adopted.                                                                                             | 
|I was                |I was born in 1981, so I’m one of the youngest people to ever have lived in the pre-online world.                                                                                                              | 
|I think              |I think my family got access to online services when I was about 14 years old.                                                                                                                                 | 
|Anyway, “cyberspace” |Anyway, “cyberspace” described this separate world, the world inside your computer when you were connected to the Internet.                                                                                    | 
|It was               |It was undoubtedly a different place than the real world.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|Today, the           |Today, the online world and the real world are one and the same.                                                                                                                                               | 
|If you               |If you were born after, say, 1987, then you have no idea how separate and different the online world, or “cyberspace,” once seemed.                                                                            | 
|So anyway,           |So anyway, in the earliest days of online shopping, which was about 15 years ago, most people either didn’t have internet connections at home or their internet connections at home weren’t stable.            | 
|Paying for           |Paying for something online was considered risky.                                                                                                                                                              | 
|You were             |You were always worried that you might be charged twice, that someone would steal your card number, or that your transaction wouldn’t go through.                                                              | 
|If you               |If you bought something online, you wanted to have the fastest and most stable internet connection possible to avoid complications.                                                                            | 
|Where did            |Where did many people have the fastest and most stable internet connections?                                                                                                                                   | 
|They had             |They had them at work.                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|According to         |According to the legend, people would see online shopping deals advertised during Thanksgiving weekend, but they wouldn’t buy them at home because they didn’t trust their internet connections at home.       | 
|They waited!         |They waited!                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|They waited          |They waited until Monday, when they got back into their offices, with their fast and secure internet connections, and they did their shopping on Monday.                                                       | 
|I have               |I have always thought this story was—let’s just say, “incomplete.”                                                                                                                                             | 
|The term             |The term “Cyber Monday” was invented by a trade organization of retailers: that should tell you something right there.                                                                                         | 
|They issued          |They issued a press release declaring that the Monday after Thanksgiving was popular with online shoppers.                                                                                                     | 
|This press           |This press release was picked up by news organizations.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|Its true             |Its true purpose was to make people feel more comfortable with the idea of online shopping.                                                                                                                    | 
|I will               |I will concede that there is some data to back this up: a large portion of online sales in the early 2010’s were done from work computers and this Monday was popular for online shopping from work computers. | 
|No argument          |No argument there.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|And in               |And in the very earliest days of the internet, the most stable connection was often at an office.                                                                                                              | 
|I can                |I can confirm people were hesitant to shop from home computers, where internet connections weren’t as fast.                                                                                                    | 
|The legend           |The legend of Cyber Monday, however, quickly departed from the reality.                                                                                                                                        | 
|After just           |After just a few years, people got more stable internet connections at home and they could easily shop over Thanksgiving weekend and Black Friday: they didn’t need to wait until Monday.                      | 
|And of               |And of course, we office workers are human: yes, online shopping from work continued, but not because of any magic about the Monday.                                                                           | 
|We shop              |We shop online at work all the time!                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Cyber Monday,        |Cyber Monday, then, turned into just another way for retailers to capture our attention and proved to fill up some quality airtime on otherwise slow news broadcasts.                                          | 
|These days,          |These days, Cyber Monday is a catch-all term for online-only sales on the web sites of traditional or online-only retailers.                                                                                   | 
|If you               |If you run an online business, like I do, you know that many online software companies run “Cyber Monday” sales.                                                                                               | 
|As the               |As the online and traditional retail worlds continue to merge, the distinction between “Cyber Monday” and “Black Friday” has blurred.                                                                          | 
|They are             |They are now just two vague terms that anchor the overall end-of-year shopping season that now starts in late October and extends until the new year.                                                          | 
|Here’s a             |Here’s a memory.                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|In the               |In the early days of online shopping, it took a long time for your payment to be processed.                                                                                                                    | 
|You would            |You would click “buy” and then you’d see a swirling circle for a full minute, which is an eternity, sometimes two or three minutes.                                                                            | 
|There would          |There would be a warning on the screen: do not click your browser’s back button.                                                                                                                               | 
|As you               |As you watched the circle swirling around, you got this feeling of dread: my payment might not go through, and there’s no way for me to know.                                                                  |
