|Very few             |Very few websites have been around as long as that.                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|Today we’re          |Today we’re going to take a brief look at its history, and how it became a household name.                                                                                                                                 | 
|Back in              |Back in the late 1990s, when the internet was first spreading into mainstream culture, people talked a lot about the newfound access to information the internet would bring.                                              | 
|The world’s          |The world’s knowledge would be at our fingertips, we were told.                                                                                                                                                            | 
|This exciting        |This exciting new era would see us all take to the “information superhighway.”                                                                                                                                             | 
|The reality          |The reality didn’t quite live up to the hype, at least at first.                                                                                                                                                           | 
|The world            |The world wide web in the 90s didn’t look anything like it does now.                                                                                                                                                       | 
|It was               |It was a lot more homespun.                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Animated “under      |Animated “under construction” gifs were commonplace.                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|It was               |It was a wild west run by enthusiasts and crackpots.                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|Official, reliable   |Official, reliable information from reputable sources was often hard to find.                                                                                                                                              | 
|If you               |If you wanted to look up a fact, you still had to search through a printed encyclopedia.                                                                                                                                   | 
|These large          |These large multivolume books were expensive and took up a lot of shelf space, so most people didn’t have one at home—to access one, you had to go to a library.                                                           | 
|Microsoft had        |Microsoft had an encyclopedia called “Encarta,” which was available on CD-ROM.                                                                                                                                             | 
|This was             |This was a slightly better option than the average web site, but the digital world had yet to deliver on its promise of easy access to knowledge for all.                                                                  | 
|In the               |In the year 2000 Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger began a project to create an online encyclopedia, which they called Nupedia.                                                                                                 | 
|Their plan           |Their plan was to have articles written and peer-reviewed by experts, but this proved to be slow going.                                                                                                                    |

|So, on               |So, on January 15, 2001, they created Wikipedia, a side-project where people could discuss articles that might be added to Nupedia.                                                                                        | 
|The fundamental      |The fundamental difference was that anyone could contribute to Wikipedia.                                                                                                                                                  | 
|The spinoff          |The spinoff proved more popular than the original.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|A month              |A month after it began, Wikipedia published its 1,000th article.                                                                                                                                                           |

|Wales and            |Wales and Sanger eventually abandoned Nupedia in 2003, by which time it had produced just 24 articles in total.                                                                                                            |

|Wikipedia has        |Wikipedia has held numerous fundraising drives over the years, and in every year of its operation has collected more in donations than it spent on running the site.                                                       |

|There was            |There was some good information to be found on Wikipedia right from the start, but there was also plenty of inaccurate material.                                                                                           |
