|On today’s            |On today’s lesson, we take a look back at “The Office,” a popular TV show when it was on the air—and a popular TV show now that we reflect on office life after almost a year away.                                                                                                                   | 
|There are             |There are two podcasts dedicated to “The Office” that are new this year, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|You’ll hear           |You’ll hear what those are, and you’ll learn what it means to “put on a brave face.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|“The Office”          |“The Office” is a television show that describes the everyday life of office workers in the late 2000s at the most boring company imaginable: the fictional Dunder Mifflin paper company in working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania.                                                                     | 
|It was                |It was popular during its 201-episode run from 2005 to 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|But now,              |But now, more than seven years after it ended, fans are taking a nostalgic look back at the familiar characters and the astonishing normality of our pre-COVID world, as represented on “The Office.”                                                                                                 | 
|The concept           |The concept was to document office life in a faux-realistic way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The style             |The style was a mockumentary: a mock documentary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|It was                |It was shot with a single camera, meaning that each scene had only one perspective, as if a single person with a camera were filming an actual office.                                                                                                                                                | 
|Some scenes           |Some scenes are shot through windows, without sound, as if the documentary filmmaker were capturing a scene from a distance.                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|The camera            |The camera moves as if a camera operator were holding it on his shoulder, walking around.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|One-on-one interviews |One-on-one interviews with cast members were interspersed with the action, again in the style of a documentary.                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|During the            |During the show’s run, many office workers were able to see their own lives reflected on screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The actors            |The actors did not have television good looks; many, including Phyllis, Angela and Kelly, were not primarily actors before the show.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|Neither did           |Neither did the lines seem scripted; they weren’t delivered as if for an audience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|People slouched       |People slouched in their chairs, mumbled their lines, rolled their eyes, and wasted time, all on camera.                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|Characters didn’t     |Characters didn’t fit into television tropes of hero and villain, protagonist and antagonist, lead and supporting actors.                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|They really           |They really felt like real people you encounter at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|Jim and               |Jim and Phyllis were likeable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
