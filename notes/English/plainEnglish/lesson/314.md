|Hi there,                |Hi there, I’m Jeff and I am ready to go here for another Plain English lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|This is                  |This is the time of the week where we get to spend about 20 or 30 minutes together talking about what’s going on in the world.                                                                                                                                  | 
|It’s my                  |It’s my favorite time of the week, recording these.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|Coming up                |Coming up today: It was an extraordinary gamble, but Joe Biden’s strategy to win the presidential election paid off.                                                                                                                                            | 
|He bet                   |He bet that his best way to win was to contrast himself with Trump and to run a socially-distant campaign.                                                                                                                                                      |

|In the                   |In the second half, we have a great expression—“make or break”—and we have a quote of the week.                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|Joe Biden’s              |Joe Biden’s journey to the White House was anything but smooth.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|His first                |His first attempt at the presidency started in June 1987, when the then-Senator ran for the Democratic nomination.                                                                                                                                              | 
|In nomination            |In nomination races, candidates try to be one of the two finalists in the race.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|Biden’s first            |Biden’s first attempt ended just three months later after one of his speeches closely resembled a speech by a British politician.                                                                                                                               | 
|He was                   |He was forced to pull out of the race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|His second               |His second attempt came in 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|He had                   |He had better luck that time, but when the voting started, he didn’t receive much support and he dropped out.                                                                                                                                                   | 
|However, he              |However, he did make enough of an impression on the eventual winner, Barack Obama.                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|Obama chose              |Obama chose him to be his running mate in 2008 and Biden served eight years as vice president.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|It would                 |It would have been natural for him to run for the top job himself in 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|As sitting               |As sitting vice president, he would have been able to ride Obama’s coattails and promise to continue to policies of a popular administration.                                                                                                                   | 
|But he                   |But he had recently lost his son, Beau, to brain cancer and he was still grieving.                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|And Hillary              |And Hillary Clinton was a political force to be reckoned with: she was the early favorite to be the Democrats’ nominee.                                                                                                                                         | 
|So Biden                 |So Biden sat out the race, and for the first time since 1969, Joe Biden did not hold public office.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|In his                   |In his mid-70s, his long career in politics seemed to be over.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|So you                   |So you can imagine the surprise when he decided to throw his hat in the ring in 2019, ahead of the 2020 election.                                                                                                                                               | 
|Everyone could           |Everyone could do the math: if he won, he would be the oldest ever to take office.                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|The competition          |The competition for the Democratic nomination was fierce.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|Democrats of             |Democrats of all stripes salivated at the opportunity to be the one to beat Donald Trump in what was expected to be an easy election.                                                                                                                           | 
|If Biden                 |If Biden wanted to win the nomination, he’d have to beat a wide field of competitive Democrats.                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|Biden’s 2020             |Biden’s 2020 campaign got off to a lethargic start.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|We detailed              |We detailed his road to the nomination in Lesson 242, but he won a few key endorsements and several other candidates dropped out of the race at the same time.                                                                                                  | 
|Support coalesced        |Support coalesced around the former vice president as Democratic voters saw him as the safest, most electable candidate in an important election.                                                                                                               | 
|That’s when              |That’s when his race against Trump really started—and it’s also when the pandemic started, upending all the traditional rules about campaigning.                                                                                                                | 
|Early on,                |Early on, Biden made a strategic decision that he would present himself as Trump’s opposite.                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|He also                  |He also decided to respect social distancing and run his campaign remotely, forgoing large rallies, extensive travel, and boots-on-the-ground grassroots campaigning.                                                                                           |

|Start with               |Start with the first decision: he would present himself as Trump’s temperamental opposite.                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|Unlike Obama             |Unlike Obama in 2008, and unlike Trump in 2016, Biden did not run on any big philosophical ideas.                                                                                                                                                               |

|I’ve mentioned           |I’ve mentioned before, the more ideological wing of the Democratic party is hungry for sweeping changes to public policy.                                                                                                                                       |

|His bet                  |His bet was that people disliked Trump’s approach, so he shrewdly positioned himself as Trump’s opposite, without having to defend any firm policy positions of his own.                                                                                        | 
|Throughout the           |Throughout the campaign, as Trump downplayed the severity of COVID-19 and disparaged medical experts, Biden again played the opposite.                                                                                                                          |

|It’s widely              |It’s widely accepted that the Trump administration was slow to respond to the threat of COVID-19 and botched the federal government’s response.                                                                                                                 |

|His message              |His message was that he’d be more competent than Trump and listen to experts.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|That same                |That same attitude extended to the campaign itself, and this, I think, was very important.                                                                                                                                                                      |

|The candidates           |The candidates crisscross the country, host large rallies, sit for media interviews, visit diners, kiss babies, tour factories, and shake as many hands as possible.                                                                                            | 
|Trump was                |Trump was a germophobe before it became popular, so shaking hands was never his style: you almost never saw him shake a voter’s hand.                                                                                                                           | 
|But he                   |But he continued to host his signature rallies—often indoors, with a crowd not wearing masks.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Republicans also         |Republicans also mobilized supporters to knock on voters’ doors in key states—a classic American campaigning tradition.                                                                                                                                         |

|If Biden                 |If Biden had boldly staked out radical policy positions, he almost definitely would have lost.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|His big                  |His big advantage was his personal contrast with Trump.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|It was                   |It was the only thing he ran on, and it was enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|I wanted                 |I wanted to highlight one feature of the Plain English Plus+ membership for you, and that is our forums.                                                                                                                                                        |

|The reason               |The reason I included this in the membership is that I know from my experience in Spanish, I sometimes read something and it just doesn’t click.                                                                                                                |

|Recently, someone        |Recently, someone asked, “What’s the difference between a report of and a report on?”                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|They’re just             |They’re just one letter different, but they mean two very different things.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
