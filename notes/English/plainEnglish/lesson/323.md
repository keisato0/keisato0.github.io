|Just when       |Just when we thought 2020 couldn’t get any more out of the norm, it again surprised us with mysterious monoliths popping up all over the world.                                          | 
|From deserts    |From deserts in the American west to hillsides in Romania to fields in Belgium and beaches in Britain, these monoliths are causing quite a stir.                                         | 
|But, wait       |But, wait a second: what exactly is a monolith?                                                                                                                                          | 
|Here’s the      |Here’s the dictionary definition.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|A monolith      |A monolith is “a single large block or piece of stone, as in architecture or sculpture.”                                                                                                 | 
|The most        |The most famous monoliths are from ancient times—for example, Stonehenge in Britain.                                                                                                     | 
|So far,         |So far, so good.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|But the         |But the Stonehenge monoliths have been there, in the same spot in Wiltshire, England, for over four thousand years.                                                                      | 
|Not these       |Not these new ones.                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|These new       |These new metal, mirrored monoliths just recently appeared in remote locations.                                                                                                          | 
|They were       |They were not created by ancient cultures.                                                                                                                                               | 
|They’re just    |They’re just huge metal pillars—like a vertical sculpture made of metal.                                                                                                                 | 
|In fact,        |In fact, they’ve been likened to the monoliths that appeared in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick.                                                                      | 
|An alien        |An alien monolith is a recurring symbol in the movie.                                                                                                                                    | 
|These monoliths |These monoliths do look like a scene straight out of a Sci-Fi movie, but are they really the work of aliens?                                                                             | 
|Let’s see       |Let’s see if we can find out.                                                                                                                                                            | 
|The first       |The first and most prominent monolith was discovered in Utah’s Red Rock country.                                                                                                         | 
|This is         |This is a remote area of the American west.                                                                                                                                              | 
|A team          |A team surveying bighorn sheep for Utah’s wildlife agency first spotted the monolith from a helicopter.                                                                                  | 
|The scientists  |The scientists were up there in a helicopter counting bighorn sheep on the ground when they saw a huge metal sculpture.                                                                  | 
|It was          |It was ten to twelve feet tall, made of stainless steel, and planted firmly in the ground.                                                                                               | 
|What added      |What added to its mystery was the location and timeline.                                                                                                                                 | 
|Somebody had    |Somebody had to use heavy machinery to embed the monolith in the ground.                                                                                                                 | 
|The remote      |The remote area has no roads nearby, making the installation even more challenging.                                                                                                      | 
|How could       |How could someone get such a heavy object there, install it, and leave without a trace?                                                                                                  | 
|And when        |And when did this happen?                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Officials had   |Officials had no idea how long the monolith had been there because park rangers rarely go there.                                                                                         | 
|NA              |Well.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|The monolith    |The monolith caused hundreds of visitors to venture into the barren area to take photos and videos.                                                                                      | 
|However, just   |However, just as quickly as it was found, the monolith disappeared on November 27.                                                                                                       | 
|But this        |But this time, there was a witness.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|An amateur      |An amateur photographer was there when four men turned up under cover of darkness.                                                                                                       | 
|The men         |The men dismantled the structure and took it away.                                                                                                                                       | 
|As they         |As they left, one of them turned to the witness and said: “Leave no trace.”                                                                                                              | 
|A few           |A few days later, a group of four men from Utah confirmed with video footage that they took down the monolith in the name of natural preservation.                                       | 
|They objected   |They objected to the hordes of people visiting the natural spot where usually humans don’t go.                                                                                           | 
|All that        |All that is left now of the monolith is a triangle-shaped hole where the monolith once stood, surrounded by the tracks of those who came to see it.                                      | 
|Ok, so          |Ok, so we know who took down the structure, but we still don’t know who created it.                                                                                                      | 
|Artists that    |Artists that specialize in minimalist structures similar to the monolith have denied creating it.                                                                                        | 
|An anonymous    |An anonymous group called The Most Famous Artist took credit for the monolith and is currently selling replicas for $45,000.                                                             | 
|Maybe, maybe    |Maybe, maybe it was them; but something’s fishy.                                                                                                                                         | 
|Maybe they      |Maybe they are the real creators, or maybe they are simply taking advantage of the publicity.                                                                                            |
