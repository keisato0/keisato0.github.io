|They might           |They might be a mystery to an international audience, where approval of the American president is quite low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|But in               |But in today’s lesson, I will endeavor to share with you the reasons that many people have for casting their vote for Trump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|This is              |This is not an evenhanded weighing of the evidence on Trump’s presidency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|I think              |I think reasons not to choose him are well-documented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|But it               |But it is instead a window into the reasons that at least 45 percent of Americans will have for their selection this fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|Of course,           |Of course, we won’t cover every conceivable reason, but it should be enough to give you a good idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|Listen to            |Listen to this: in a recent survey of over 13,000 adults, the respected Pew Research Center found that just 16 percent of respondents had confidence in President Donald Trump.                                                                                                                                                                          |

|On November          |On November 3, something like sixty million people will have cast their presidential vote for Donald Trump—about 45 percent of the American electorate if today’s polls are any indication.                                                                                                                                                             |

|This lesson          |This lesson is about the reasons Americans have for supporting this man, who is so deeply unpopular around the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|If you               |If you are like the Pew survey respondents, you are left stupefied by why Americans would re-elect this man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|You might            |You might not agree with their decision, but it is good to know why so many people will vote for Trump this fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The first            |The first thing you need to know is that America has experienced a very deep cultural separation in the last decade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|The advance          |The advance of technology, the increase in the so-called “knowledge economy,” globalization, changes in demographics, a reduced prominence of religion in public life, and a rapidly-changing culture have left many people feeling that their values and traditions are being eroded—and that few national leaders or institutions are on their side. | 
|Certain institutions |Certain institutions define the culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
