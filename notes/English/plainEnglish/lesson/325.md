|Hi there,         |Hi there, welcome to the last Plain English lesson of 2020, number 325.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|Coming up         |Coming up today: After the year we’ve just had, I would never venture to predict the future.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|So instead        |So instead of predictions for 2021, I’ll just give you five questions to think about as we go into next year.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|The expression    |The expression is “for good”—and I’m just warning you, it’s not about good or bad.                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|And we            |And we have a song of the week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|The first         |The first question on everyone’s mind: When will life get back to normal?                                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The first         |The first doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being distributed as we speak.                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|Russia and        |Russia and China have also developed and distributed vaccines, though they have not published the data as openly as the global pharmaceutical companies have.                                                                                                    | 
|The World         |The World Health Organization has a program called COVAX, which will help distribute 2 billion doses and counting to the developing world in the first half of 2021.                                                                                             | 
|At the            |At the same time, treatments for COVID are improving and the hospitalization rate and death rate are dropping.                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Getting COVID     |Getting COVID is not as bad as it once was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|This should       |This should protect the most vulnerable people and allow the world to get back to some sense of normal.                                                                                                                                                          | 
|But it            |But it will take time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|If I              |If I had to make a prediction, I would say that the third quarter of 2021 is when the rhythm of pre-COVID life will resume—restaurants, offices, movies, music.                                                                                                  | 
|But it            |But it might be until well into 2022 that we see packed dance floors, stadiums, trains, and buses in most places.                                                                                                                                                | 
|Second question:  |Second question: Who will lead Europe?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|German Chancellor |German Chancellor Angela Merkel will step down after the federal election in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|She will          |She will have been Germany’s leader for sixteen years, tied for a post-war record.                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|As leader         |As leader of continental Europe’s biggest economy, she has been the EU’s de-facto leader for much of that time.                                                                                                                                                  | 
|She has           |She has been a competent, centrist leader and steadily managed crises, including the financial crisis of 2009, Brexit, terrorism, coronavirus, and waves of migrants from the Middle East and Africa.                                                            | 
|She does          |She does not have a clear successor, either for her official post as Chancellor of Germany or for her unofficial post as leader of the EU.                                                                                                                       | 
|Europe’s success  |Europe’s success often depends on the relationship between the French president and German chancellor, so this will be a development to watch in 2021.                                                                                                           |

|2020 was          |2020 was a bad year in many respects, but not if have investments in Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft: shares of the five biggest technology companies have risen by about 50 percent this year, and that includes the stock market crash in March. | 
|The dominance     |The dominance of “big tech”—the five biggest companies—is starting to attract unwelcome attention.                                                                                                                                                               | 
|Both America      |Both America and Europe are investigating Facebook and Google for anticompetitive practices.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|The US            |The US government and several American states are suing Facebook, alleging that its purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram should be reversed.                                                                                                                      | 
|One of            |One of the only things that unites politicians on both sides of America’s political divide is antipathy toward Facebook and big tech monopolies.                                                                                                                 | 
|Many people       |Many people believe the tech companies have gotten too powerful, and that they harm consumers by being monopolies—in search and advertising.                                                                                                                     | 
|The question      |The question is, will this have teeth?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Will anything     |Will anything come of these lawsuits, or will big tech be able to continue as normal?                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|Investors don’t   |Investors don’t seem to mind: the shares of big tech companies continue to rise.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|But I             |But I think this is a big question for 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|How much          |How much will big tech have to change in response to questions about its size and influence?                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|The epic          |The epic antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the 1990s dragged on for six years, so don’t expect this question to be resolved in 2021.                                                                                                                        | 
|Another question: |Another question: Will populism recede?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
|Populism refers   |Populism refers to a general political stance where a leader claims to be standing up for “the people” against an “elite.”                                                                                                                                       | 
|For example,      |For example, when the UK voted to leave the EU, many voters said they wanted to take back control of their politics and policies, and not have to follow the dictates coming from Brussels.                                                                      | 
|The Brexit        |The Brexit vote in 2016 set off a wave of populist elections around the world: Trump in America, Bolsonaro in Brazil, Orban in Hungary, AMLO in Mexico.                                                                                                          |

|The question      |The question is whether Trump’s defeat bodes ill for other populists in power, or whether the populist movement continues.                                                                                                                                       |

|With fewer        |With fewer people making a daily journey to work, the need for robust public transit may be lower.                                                                                                                                                               | 
|Americans in      |Americans in particular aren’t in love with public transit to begin with: they may decide they like car journeys better.                                                                                                                                         |
