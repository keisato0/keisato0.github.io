|About every        |About every six months, we revisit some previous lesson topics and talk about what’s new about those topics.                                                                                                                                       | 
|Today, we’ll       |Today, we’ll revisit the Russian activist Alexei Navalny, professional sports, electric scooters, non-alcoholic drinks, and the race for a Covid vaccine.                                                                                          |

|We first           |We first met Alexei Navalny in Lesson 20  back in February 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|At the             |At the time, he had been leading a movement to boycott the upcoming Russian elections.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|The Russian        |The Russian government arrested him to keep him quiet ahead of the vote in March 2018.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|He was             |He was back in the international news again, this time after collapsing on a flight from Siberia to Moscow.                                                                                                                                        | 
|He fell            |He fell into a coma and was transferred to Germany, where he received treatment.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|The German         |The German government investigated and said Navalny had been poisoned with the military-grade nerve agent Novichuk.                                                                                                                                | 
|Navalny’s chief    |Navalny’s chief of staff said the use of Novichuk is the same thing as leaving an autograph at the scene of the crime, implying that the Russian president had no desire to hide that he was behind Navalny’s poisoning.                           | 
|Meanwhile, Germany |Meanwhile, Germany is about to inaugurate a large natural gas pipeline connecting Russian gas with European consumers; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been tolerating Russia’s bad geopolitical behavior, but she is now losing patience. | 
|The episode        |The episode could lead Germany, and by extension Europe, to take a more hardline stance against Russia in the future, though the pipeline will probably still open.                                                                                | 
|The 44-year-old    |The 44-year-old Navaly was released from the hospital on September 23 and posted a selfie with his wife, thanking everyone who worked to save his life.                                                                                            | 
|Sports in          |Sports in the Covid era: we asked what that would be like in Lesson 266  back in June.                                                                                                                                                             |

|American baseball  |American baseball played a sixty-game season with no fans in the stands.                                                                                                                                                                           | 
|It was             |It was strange watching the games, and a little eerie at first.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
|Baseball stadiums  |Baseball stadiums pumped in fake crowd noise, which helped re-create the traditional atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                   | 
|A few              |A few teams got into Covid trouble early and had to miss parts of their schedule, but the abbreviated season was otherwise a success.                                                                                                              | 
|Pro basketball,    |Pro basketball, ice hockey, and pro soccer finished their interrupted seasons in “bubbles.”                                                                                                                                                        | 
|A bubble           |A bubble is where the teams are sequestered in one or two cities and play all their games at a single location.                                                                                                                                    | 
|This is            |This is designed to cut down on travel and exposure to Covid.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|It works           |It works for tournament-style play, but would not be feasible for an entire season.                                                                                                                                                                | 
|NBA games          |NBA games featured video screens in the spectator area—instead of live spectators, they showed streams of dedicated fans watching at home.                                                                                                         | 
|In Europe,         |In Europe, football stadiums have started to welcome fans back, but at limited capacities.                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Every country      |Every country is a little different, but France, Italy, Germany, Spain and others are setting capacity limits of 20 or 30 percent at first, with specific limits determined by the incidence of the virus in a given city.                         | 
|Fifteen thousand   |Fifteen thousand fans saw Bayern Munich raise the UEFA Super Cup in Budapest at the end of last month.                                                                                                                                             | 
|Pro football       |Pro football in America is taking a similar approach, with some stadiums allowing a small number of fans, while other stadiums remain empty.                                                                                                       | 
|Brazil wants       |Brazil wants stadiums to be 30 percent full soon, but football is on hold for the moment.                                                                                                                                                          | 
|France managed     |France managed to stage its entire Tour de France without a single positive Covid case, even with some spectators.                                                                                                                                 |

|We talked          |We talked about how the sleek scooters from Lime, Bird, and other startup brands were popping up in cities around the world.                                                                                                                       |

|Not everyone       |Not everyone was happy, though: unused scooters clogged sidewalks, blocked entrances, and were an eyesore on many city streets.                                                                                                                    | 
|The beginning      |The beginning of the pandemic was tough on electric scooter makers.                                                                                                                                                                                |
