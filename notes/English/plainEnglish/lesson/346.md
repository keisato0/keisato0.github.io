|Coming up       |Coming up today: we’re going to talk about one of the year’s best movies, Nomadland.                                                                                                                          | 
|This isn’t      |This isn’t a movie with an exciting or mysterious plot, so there aren’t any real spoilers.                                                                                                                    | 
|But like        |But like always, I do describe some scenes and characters.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|So if           |So if you don’t want to know anything about Nomadland, then maybe save this lesson for until after you watch it.                                                                                              | 
|However, I      |However, I can assure you that you can still enjoy this great movie even after hearing this lesson.                                                                                                           | 
|I won’t         |I won’t spoil the fun for you.                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|In the          |In the second half of today’s lesson, we review a phrasal verb, “run into” and we have a quote of the week.                                                                                                   | 
|In Nomadland,   |In Nomadland, we meet a character and a lifestyle that’s not often given a prominent role in Hollywood movies.                                                                                                | 
|The main        |The main character, Fern, is a sixty-one-year-old widow.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The small       |The small western town of Empire, Nevada, is reeling after its biggest employer shuts down.                                                                                                                   | 
|Fern’s husband  |Fern’s husband worked there before he died.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Without the     |Without the main employer, there are few jobs for the many unemployed people to take.                                                                                                                         | 
|A worker        |A worker at the employment agency advises Fern to start taking Social Security, her government pension, instead of trying to find work.                                                                       | 
|Fern’s pension  |Fern’s pension would not be enough to live on, so she becomes a nomad: a person who moves from place to place.                                                                                                | 
|It’s a          |It’s a romantic concept: as a nomad, you’re never tied down; a new adventure always awaits.                                                                                                                   | 
|The world       |The world is in the palm of your hand.                                                                                                                                                                        | 
|The term        |The term “digital nomad” means someone with an online business or location-independent job that hops around from place to glamorous place—Bali this month, Medellín next month, Estonia the month after that. | 
|Fern isn’t      |Fern isn’t that kind of nomad.                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|Without savings |Without savings or a steady income, she bounces from job to job.                                                                                                                                              | 
|She sleeps      |She sleeps in her van at RV parks, areas where you can either camp or stay in your vehicle and enjoy some amenities.                                                                                          | 
|The first       |The first job we see is at an Amazon warehouse, presumably during the holiday shopping rush.                                                                                                                  | 
|Later, she      |Later, she gets a job as a guide at Badlands National Park in South Dakota; she works another season at Wall Drug, a big tourist attraction for road-trippers out west.                                       | 
|She meets       |She meets good friends.                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|One convinces   |One convinces her to attend a convention for nomads in the south.                                                                                                                                             | 
|There, she      |There, she finds more friends, a support system, and a community of people who lead a similar lifestyle, some by choice, others not.                                                                          | 
|Most are        |Most are older, all are living on the fringes of the economy.                                                                                                                                                 | 
|The jobs        |The jobs they get are insecure and pay low wages.                                                                                                                                                             | 
|The most        |The most poignant scene takes place in a sporting goods store back in Empire, Nevada.                                                                                                                         | 
|Fern is         |Fern is idly browsing camping gear and falls asleep in a chair.                                                                                                                                               | 
|She wakes       |She wakes up with a start and runs into an acquaintance: a mother with her teenage daughter.                                                                                                                  | 
|The mother      |The mother is younger than Fern is, stylish and comfortable-looking.                                                                                                                                          | 
|We learn        |We learn they had been friends before, and that Fern had even tutored the daughter.                                                                                                                           | 
|The mother      |The mother gives Fern a compassionate look and delicately inquires about where Fern is living.                                                                                                                | 
|When Fern       |When Fern answers that she is in her van, she implies that it’s temporary, that she’s between houses.                                                                                                         | 
|The mother      |The mother leans in and offers, in a quiet voice, to let Fern stay with them.                                                                                                                                 | 
|Fern won’t      |Fern won’t hear of it; she has her pride and won’t let herself accept the charity of another person.                                                                                                          | 
|She declines    |She declines the offer, and it clearly pains the mother that her offer was not accepted.                                                                                                                      | 
|A few           |A few seconds later, the teenager approaches Fern without her mother present.                                                                                                                                 | 
|They chat       |They chat pleasantly for a bit.                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|“My mom         |“My mom says you’re homeless,” the teenager then says.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|“Is that        |“Is that true?”                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|And so          |And so we learn what is said about Fern behind closed doors.                                                                                                                                                  | 
|We can          |We can feel the judgment in the word “homeless” and the way it wounds Fern’s pride.                                                                                                                           | 
|Fern replies    |Fern replies that she isn’t homeless; she’s just “house-less.”                                                                                                                                                | 
|But she         |But she is homeless in the way most people understand the word.                                                                                                                                               |
