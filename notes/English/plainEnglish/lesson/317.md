|The full        |The full and complete lesson is available at PlainEnglish.com/317.                                                                                                                           | 
|Coming up       |Coming up today: NASA scientists have discovered water on the sunlit portions of the Moon.                                                                                                   | 
|This follows    |This follows a discovery a few years ago of water on the dark side of the Moon.                                                                                                              | 
|We’ll talk      |We’ll talk about what exactly they found and what this could mean for the future of space exploration.                                                                                       | 
|The second      |The second half of the program is all about expressions, and today’s expression is “cut down on.”                                                                                            | 
|And JR          |And JR has a song of the week.                                                                                                                                                               | 
|NASA is         |NASA is confirming there is water on the Moon, and on more parts of the Moon than previously thought.                                                                                        | 
|Back in         |Back in August 2018, researchers found significant ice deposits in the cold and dark areas of the Moon, including in cratered areas that are permanently shadowed.                           | 
|The question    |The question remained whether water could exist on the sunlit parts of Earth’s closest neighbor.                                                                                             | 
|In October      |In October space researchers confirmed the presence of water on the Moon’s sunlit surface.                                                                                                   | 
|This new        |This new breakthrough suggests that water, essential for life on Earth, is distributed across even more of the Moon’s surface.                                                               | 
|Researchers say |Researchers say they didn’t find puddles of water but instead found water molecules so widely dispersed that don’t even form what we traditionally think of as liquid water or ice.          | 
|Learning more   |Learning more about the newly discovered Moon water is important for America’s plans to explore the Moon and beyond.                                                                         | 
|Why is          |Why is that?                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
|Well, we        |Well, we know that water is essential for life here on Earth.                                                                                                                                | 
|If there’s      |If there’s water on the Moon, it could be recycled inside a lunar habitat or used for drinking water or bathing for people who may stay up there on scientific missions.                     | 
|In a            |In a more far-fetched scenario, it could also be used to help grow plants on the Moon, which could (possibly, some day) be used to feed astronauts.                                          | 
|But perhaps     |But perhaps the biggest and most realistic impact could be for fueling rockets.                                                                                                              | 
|The chemical    |The chemical components of water — hydrogen and oxygen — are two of the most important elements used to power rockets.                                                                       | 
|And making      |And making rocket fuel out of the water on the Moon could drastically cut down on the cost of doing challenging missions farther off in space.                                               | 
|Right now,      |Right now, rockets leaving Earth have to carry all the fuel they need with them for their whole journey.                                                                                     | 
|That limits     |That limits how deep into space rockets can go.                                                                                                                                              | 
|But with        |But with lunar ice, rockets might be able to land on the moon and refuel once they get there.                                                                                                | 
|If that         |If that were possible, they could reach even more distant locations in space.                                                                                                                | 
|That would      |That would make deep-space missions more feasible.                                                                                                                                           | 
|Water from      |Water from the Moon could be mined, broken apart into its components, transformed into rocket fuel, and transported to a lunar fuel station depot either on the Moon or in low Earth orbit.  | 
|Then, rockets   |Then, rockets could refuel there instead of carrying all their propellant when they leave Earth.                                                                                             | 
|I mentioned     |I mentioned earlier that the water was dispersed and it wasn’t collecting in puddles or deposits.                                                                                            | 
|So how          |So how do we know it’s there?                                                                                                                                                                | 
|NASA used       |NASA used a tool called “SOFIA”— short for Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy to make the discovery.                                                                           | 
|SOFIA is        |SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747 that goes as high as 45,000 feet up into the Earth’s atmosphere.                                                                                              | 
|The height      |The height is vital because it lets researchers gaze at objects in space without the visual disruption caused by water vapor in the Earth’s atmosphere.                                      | 
|To detect       |To detect the water molecules, SOFIA used an infrared camera, which detects the heat of objects far away.                                                                                    | 
|For a           |For a time, researchers had suspected there was water on the Moon, but they were not able to tell whether what they were seeing was water or water’s close chemical cousin, hydroxy, or O-H. | 
|The advanced    |The advanced instrumentation on SOFIA allowed them to conclude that, yes, what they were seeing was indeed water.                                                                            | 
|Where was       |Where was it hiding?                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Water can’t     |Water can’t collect on the surface because of the extreme temperatures and the fact that the Moon doesn’t have much of an atmosphere.                                                        | 
|Without some    |Without some type of protection, water would just be lost to space and not preserved on the surface of the Moon.                                                                             | 
|But, that’s     |But, that’s not what’s happening, water is forming and becoming trapped there.                                                                                                               | 
|The current     |The current thinking is that the water molecules are most likely stored in naturally occurring volcanic glass or sandwiched between microscopic grains of rock dust.                         | 
|The next        |The next step in the research would be to find out exactly how the water formed, and why it persists.                                                                                        | 
|NASA is         |NASA is about to start follow-up observations on SOFIA.                                                                                                                                      | 
|They are        |They are now hoping to map a majority of the Moon’s surface to determine where water exists and what its behavior is like.                                                                   | 
|What an         |What an amazing discovery.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|Stop and        |Stop and think for a second about this.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|They were       |They were able to find water trapped in glass beads on the Moon.                                                                                                                             | 
|That is         |That is just incredible.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
|If you          |If you liked this topic and you’re looking for a good book to read in English, I would recommend reading “The Martian” by Andy Weir.                                                         | 
|It’s fiction,   |It’s fiction, but it was written by a space scientist in his spare time, and many reviewers say the science is pretty solid.                                                                 | 
|I would         |I would not be in a position to say, but I can tell you that it’s entertaining.                                                                                                              | 
|It’s also       |It’s also a movie, but I think you’d like the book.                                                                                                                                          |
