|Coming up            |Coming up today: The most famous thing in Earth’s orbit is the moon.                                                                                                                                          | 
|The next-most-famous |The next-most-famous thing is the International Space Station.                                                                                                                                                | 
|But did              |But did you know that there are hundreds of thousands of man-made objects circling our planet?                                                                                                                | 
|And did              |And did you know that the vast majority of that is junk—hurtling through space, waiting to crash into satellites, rockets, and even the Space Station?                                                        | 
|Even more            |Even more alarming, there’s no proven way to get rid of space junk once it’s in Earth’s orbit.                                                                                                                | 
|The expression       |The expression we’ll talk about today is “close call.”                                                                                                                                                        | 
|And JR               |And JR has a song of the week.                                                                                                                                                                                | 
|By the               |By the way, here’s a quick definition before we start.                                                                                                                                                        | 
|“Junk” is            |“Junk” is an informal word meaning, “discarded objects.”                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The drawer           |The drawer in my office at work is full of junk.                                                                                                                                                              | 
|I’m dreading         |I’m dreading the day I go back and have to clean it out.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|Your garage          |Your garage might be full of junk.                                                                                                                                                                            | 
|Just old             |Just old toys, spare parts from a lawn mower, chargers for devices that stopped working in 2007, a flat tire: all these things are junk you might find in a garage.                                           | 
|So that’s            |So that’s the word “junk,” and now you’re ready for Lesson 303.                                                                                                                                               | 
|What goes            |What goes up must come down: the maxim is true everywhere on earth.                                                                                                                                           | 
|It is                |It is not true, however, in outer space.                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|And that’s           |And that’s a problem for satellites, space shuttles, space stations, astronauts, and really anything that goes up into space.                                                                                 | 
|Anything launched    |Anything launched a few hundred miles above the earth will eventually be pulled down toward the earth’s surface.                                                                                              | 
|Most objects         |Most objects burn up or disintegrate as they pass through the atmosphere.                                                                                                                                     | 
|But get              |But get high enough into earth’s orbit and objects won’t fall down: they’ll spin indefinitely around our planet.                                                                                              | 
|These objects        |These objects include active satellites, former satellites, spare parts, bodies of old rockets, and other debris—together, anything not active or functional is called “space junk.”                          | 
|The US               |The US military closely monitors a catalog of tens of thousands of space junk objects that are at least ten centimeters in diameter.                                                                          | 
|Ten centimeters      |Ten centimeters is about three times the size of a tennis ball, for perspective.                                                                                                                              | 
|Those are            |Those are the biggest objects that can cause the most damage if they collide with something.                                                                                                                  | 
|There are            |There are between 500,000 and one million objects between one and ten centimeters in diameter circling the earth at high speeds—in other words, the size of a marble and larger.                              | 
|These are            |These are small, but still dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                         | 
|Go a                 |Go a little smaller and some estimates say that there are up to 100 million objects that are a millimeter or more in diameter.                                                                                | 
|These are            |These are the very, very small objects.                                                                                                                                                                       | 
|But they             |But they are circling the earth at a terrifying speed: about 17,000 miles per hour.                                                                                                                           | 
|Even a               |Even a small object moving at a high speed can cause a lot of damage.                                                                                                                                         | 
|Consider this:       |Consider this: if a single one-centimeter-long bolt crashed into something in space, it would have the same explosive force as a hand grenade would on earth.                                                 | 
|That could           |That could bring down a large commercial or military satellite.                                                                                                                                               | 
|A single             |A single fleck of paint, hurtling through space, can damage the exterior of a space shuttle or the space station.                                                                                             | 
|This is              |This is more than a theoretical discussion.                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|In September,        |In September, a single small piece of space debris recently came close to crashing into the International Space Station.                                                                                      | 
|It might             |It might have destroyed the entire International Space Station.                                                                                                                                               | 
|To prepare,          |To prepare, astronauts on board took shelter in the Soyuz capsule that could take them back to earth in case of an emergency.                                                                                 | 
|In the               |In the end, the object passed within eight-tenths of a mile of the Space Station.                                                                                                                             | 
|Eight-tenths of      |Eight-tenths of a mile is nothing in space: a catastrophe was narrowly averted.                                                                                                                               | 
|This was             |This was not the first close call at the International Space Station, nor will it be the last.                                                                                                                | 
|The US               |The US military tracks tens of thousands of large objects circling the earth.                                                                                                                                 | 
|When one             |When one looks like it might collide with the Space Station, the Space Station moves safely out of its way.                                                                                                   | 
|But they             |But they need a minimum of five-and-a-half hours’ notice to do so; sometimes the objects sneak up on them and sometimes they can’t move the station fast enough.                                              | 
|In those             |In those cases, astronauts need to prepare to evacuate in case the worst happens.                                                                                                                             | 
|It’s not             |It’s not just astronauts that are in danger.                                                                                                                                                                  | 
|In 2009,             |In 2009, two satellites crashed in orbit: an active American one and a defunct Russian one.                                                                                                                   | 
|The American         |The American owner lost its satellite, but that’s not the end of the story.                                                                                                                                   | 
|When two             |When two things collide in space, they break apart.                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Those two            |Those two satellites crashed into each other at high speeds and the broke apart, adding thousands of smaller, but still dangerous, objects into orbit.                                                        | 
|Space scientists     |Space scientists are worried about something called the “Kessler effect,” named after the NASA scientist that first described it.                                                                             | 
|Objects in           |Objects in space, if they’re up high enough, don’t fall down to earth; in space, they don’t disintegrate.                                                                                                     | 
|That means           |That means they might stay up there for thousands of years, if not longer, spinning around, waiting to crash into one another.                                                                                | 
|If the               |If the the earth is circled by large and small objects, they will eventually collide.                                                                                                                         | 
|When they            |When they collide, they break up; as they break up into smaller, more numerous pieces, collisions will happen more often.                                                                                     | 
|The dystopian        |The dystopian outcome seems inevitable: more and more collisions will create a thick cloud of tiny space objects, eventually making it impossible to use this portion of the earth’s orbit.                   | 
|That could           |That could imperil communications, weather forecasting, navigation, and military uses of satellites.                                                                                                          | 
|It could             |It could seriously hamper our ability to launch scientific missions that need to pass through low earth orbit to gather information about the universe.                                                       | 
|As ever,             |As ever, it is easier to pollute than it is to clean up.                                                                                                                                                      | 
|The first            |The first step is to stop making the problem worse.                                                                                                                                                           | 
|Space agencies       |Space agencies and governments are starting to follow voluntary guidelines that say that defunct equipment should be returned to earth and collisions of large objects should be actively avoided.            | 
|There is             |There is also a technical race for a way to remove the largest abandoned objects from space.                                                                                                                  | 
|A team               |A team in England is testing a contraption that would capture a large space object in a net and pull it down to earth; a team in Japan is experimenting with using large magnets to attract objects in space. | 
|The European         |The European Space Agency is planning to launch a robot that would capture a defunct rocket and bring it back to earth.                                                                                       | 
|If you               |If you saw the movie “Gravity,” this might sound familiar.                                                                                                                                                    | 
|In the               |In the movie, there’s a military conflict that sets off the “Kessler effect” where a cloud of debris is so dense that it doesn’t allow astronauts to get back to earth.                                       | 
|Scientists say       |Scientists say this isn’t an accurate depiction—not that it can’t happen, just that it can’t happen so fast.                                                                                                  | 
|Like so              |Like so many things, this is a gathering danger that happens over the long run, instead of all at once.                                                                                                       |
